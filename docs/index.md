# **Actuarial Exam Notes**

Hello!

This website was started **after** I passed the introductory exams (P, FM & IFM). As such, there are **little to no content** for these sections, apart from the **limited content** that was repeated in future exams (EG. IFM Options repeated in FAM Options).

My notes for the introductory exams are in word/pdf form. I do *aspire* to one day upload them onto this website so that it can serve as a "complete" resource for SOA exams; but it is not a high priority for me at this time.

All images used in this website are credited in the raw markdown files that were used to build the website. If there are any issues with the use of the images, please reach out to me via Github.
