# **Overview of Actuarial Mathematics**

These set of exams cover the main concepts needed to evaluate insurance related risks. They are split into two main exams:

1. Fundamentals of Actuarial Mathematics (FAM)
2. Advanced Long Term or Short Term Actuarial Mathematics (ALTAM or ASTAM)

This set of notes splits the FAM component into two seperate components for clarity, as the components are not related to one another:

1. FAM-S (Short Term)
2. FAM-L (Long Term)

However, the actual FAM exam tests **both components together** in an MCQ format. It is regarded as one of the tougher examinations due to its wide breadth (due to the unrelated components).
