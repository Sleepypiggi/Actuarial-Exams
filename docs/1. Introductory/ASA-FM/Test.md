# [Chapter 1: Interest Measurement]{.underline}

## Overview of Interest Theory

-   Assume we want to grow our money with just a **SINGLE deposit**

-   Our initial deposit is known as the **principal amount** and how
    much earn on that is known as the **interest payments** (As
    compensation for the loss of use of money)

-   There are two types of growth we can experience:

    -   **Linear Growth** → Simple Interest

    -   **Exponential Growth** → Compound Interest

    -   Simple Interest initially earns more than Compound interest. But
        in the long run, **because Interest will earn interest**,
        Compound Interest will earn more

-   Compound Interest powerful because the interest is essentially
    reinvested at the same rate**. If we were to withdraw the interest
    each period, we would have simple interest**

## Mathematical Notation

### Amount function, $\mathbf{A}\left( \mathbf{t} \right)$

-   $A(t) = A(0)*a(t)$

-   Represents the total amount of money in that fund **at that point of
    time**

### Accumulation Function, $\mathbf{a}\left( \mathbf{t} \right)$

-   Represents the **change in money from time 0 to time** $\mathbf{t}$

    -   **Simple Interest (Linear) →** $a(t) = 1 + it$

    -   **Compound Interest (Polynomial) →**$\ a(t) = (1 + i)^{t}$

    -   **Double/Triple growth (Integer)** → $a(t) = 2\ or\ 3$

-   It is a **special case of the amount function** where the initial
    amount is 1. Thus, by multiplying any initial amount to it, we
    obtain the total amount.

    -   Additionally, it also means that **any formula that uses**
        $\mathbf{A}\left( \mathbf{t} \right)$ in both numerator and
        denominators can be **substituted with**
        $\mathbf{a}\left( \mathbf{t} \right)$

-   If our **starting time is not 0**, we use a more general expression
    of the amount function $a_{k}(t - k)$ where it represents the
    **change in value from time 0 to time** $\mathbf{k}$

    -   $a_{k}(t - k) = \frac{a(t)}{a(k)} \rightarrow \mathbf{Intuitive\ through\ recursion\ \&\ forward\ rates}$

### Interest Function, $\mathbf{I}\left( \mathbf{t} \right)$

-   $I(t) = A(t) - A(t - 1) = A(0)\left\lbrack a(t) - a(t - 1) \right\rbrack$

-   Since the only change in the fund is interest, we can find it by
    taking the **difference in amounts** across two periods

## Visualizing via Timelines

-   To save on memory work, it is important that we understand **how
    formulas are derived** so that we can apply it to any context

-   The first thing we should do for any question is to **draw a
    timeline** of the cashflows

-   There are some important points we should remember:

    -   Cash Inflows or Outflows should be **strictly on one side** of
        the timeline respectively

    -   The units of time can be in **any units** (Years, Months) & with
        **any interpretation** (End or start of the period). The
        important thing is to **label it and be consistent**

    -   It is good practice to **mark out the comparison date** we want
        to use so that we do not get confused along the way

    -   Subtracting time depends on the cashflows we want to consider:

        -   By default, it **assumes that only one of the end points**
            has a cashflow

        -   We need to **add 1 period if both end points** has a
            cashflow

## Effective Interest

-   Unlike the simplified example earlier, most amount functions don't
    have smooth curves

-   The fund grows at different rates at different times during the
    period. We can **summarize the entire growth into an effective
    interest rate for that period**

-   This creates a **standardized measure of growth** during the period.
    Two funds with the same effective interest will lead to the same
    amounts, regardless of their volatility

-   These interest rates can be Yearly, monthly etc. The **key is to be
    consistent** with the time periods you use throughout the same
    calculations:

    -   Convert time periods to be expressed in the **same way as
        effective interest**

    -   Convert effective interest to be expressed in the **same way as
        time periods**

$$i_{t} = \frac{\text{Fund\ growth}\text{\ during\ the\ period}\ (Interest)}{\mathbf{Initial\ fund\ value}\ at\ the\ start\ of\ period} = \frac{A(t) - A(t - 1)}{A(t - 1)} = \frac{a(t) - a(t - 1)}{a(t - 1)}$$

### Deriving Amount Function:

$$i_{t} = \frac{A(t) - A(t - 1)}{A(t - 1)}$$

$$i_{t}*A(t - 1) = A(t) - A(t - 1)$$

$$A(t) = A(t - 1) + i_{t}*A(t - 1)$$

$$A(t) = A(t - 1)\left\lbrack 1 + i_{t} \right\rbrack$$

We can recursively add to this formula...

$$A(t) = A(t - 2)*\left\lbrack 1 + i_{t - 1} \right\rbrack*\left\lbrack 1 + i_{t} \right\rbrack$$

$$A(t) = A(t - 3)*\left\lbrack 1 + i_{t - 2} \right\rbrack*\left\lbrack 1 + i_{t - 1} \right\rbrack*\left\lbrack 1 + i_{t} \right\rbrack$$

$$\vdots$$

$$A(t) = A(0)*\left\lbrack 1 + i_{1} \right\rbrack*\left\lbrack 1 + i_{2} \right\rbrack*\ldots\left\lbrack 1 + i_{t} \right\rbrack$$

If we have a **constant effective interest** across all periods,

$$A(t) = A(0)*\lbrack 1 + i\rbrack^{t}$$

More generally, if we start at time k and end at time t,

$$A(t) = A(k)*\lbrack 1 + i\rbrack^{t - k}$$

### Expressing Interest Rates

-   Typically expressed as a **Percentage**, where $1\% = 0.01$

-   For extremely small interest rates, it could be expressed as **Basis
    Points** instead, where $1\ BP = 0.01\% = 0.00001$

## Time Value of Money

-   "A dollar today is worth more than a dollar in the future"

-   This is based off the principal of interest. If you invested the
    dollar today, you should be getting $\left( 1 + i_{t} \right)^{t}$
    in the future. Conversely, a dollar in the future is worth
    $\frac{1}{\left( 1 + i_{t} \right)^{t}}$ today

-   Bringing values into the future is known as **Accumulating** which
    results in the **Future Value.** Conversely, bringing future ones
    into the present is known as **Discounting** which results in the
    **Present Value**

-   The key is that when working with cashflows across different time
    periods, we should **bring them to the same point in time, be it
    present or future to compare them**

$$\mathbf{Present\ Value,\ A}\left( \mathbf{k} \right) = \frac{A(t)}{\left\lbrack 1 + i_{t} \right\rbrack^{t - k}} = A(t)*\left\lbrack 1 + i_{t} \right\rbrack^{- (t - k)}$$

$$\mathbf{Future\ Value,\ A}\left( \mathbf{t} \right) = A(k)*\left\lbrack 1 + i_{t} \right\rbrack^{t - k}$$

-   Notice that the formulas are almost identical with the main
    difference being the starting value and the exponent

-   The FV has a **Positive Exponent**, signifying that we are **going
    forward in time** while the PV has a **Negative Exponent**,
    signifying that we are **going backwards in time**

-   Since we use discounting and compounding so often, we use the
    **variable**
    $\mathbf{v =}\frac{\mathbf{1}}{\mathbf{a}\left( \mathbf{t} \right)}$
    to represent the **Discount Factor** so that we simplify our
    workings

## Effective Rate of Discount

-   Instead of Effective Interest Rates which measure the Interest
    relative to the starting fund value, another standardized way of
    measuring growth is **Effective rate of Discount**, which measures
    **Interest relative to the ending fund value instead**

-   They are simply **an alternative measure to Interest Rates**, and
    can be used in a similar fashion to accumulate or discount values

-   **DO NOT** **confuse it with the discount factor.** The discount
    factor is simply a notation we use to simplify the equation while
    discount rate is a completely new concept

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

**Another way** to think about it is that Interest rates are usually
paid at the end of the period, while discount rates is interest that is
paid at the start of the period instead. But both are equivalent:

$$d = \frac{i}{1 + i} = i*\frac{1}{1 + i} = iv$$

## Compounding Frequency & Nominal Rates

-   Compounding annually is just one of the ways we can compound. We
    could **compound interest Monthly, Quarterly, semi-annually** etc

-   However, quoting effective rates with different timespans can become
    confusing. Thus, we multiply to make them reflect an annual
    **nominal rate** instead:

    -   Monthly rates multiply by 12; Quarterly rate multiply by 4

-   The word nominal means **"in name only"**, which implies that these
    rates are just placeholders. If we actually compound 12 months using
    a monthly rate VS compounding once using the nominal rate, we get
    two different values

-   This is because the **nominal rate is in name only and not to be
    used**. Unfortunately, most interest rates are quoted in nominal
    terms. We always need to **remember that to convert nominal rates to
    effective rates.**

### Definition of $\mathbf{m}$

-   $m$ refers to the **number of times interest is compounded within a
    year**

    -   Compound once a year → $m = 1$

        -   EG. One year annual effective rate

    -   Compound multiple times a year → $m > 1$

        -   EG. 1-year nominal rate, compounded monthly

    -   Compound once in a few years → $m < 1$

        -   EG. 4-year nominal rate, compounded yearly

-   Assuming the **SAME effective rate of interest**, the above diagram
    provides a visual representation of the values of the various rates

-   Effective rates are always at the **tail ends** -- They move toward
    the centre as the compounding frequency for each type of rate, with
    infinite compounding (Force of interest) as the midpoint between
    both

    -   **Nominal Interest Rate is always lower than the equivalent
        effective rate**. This allows companies to give the false
        perception of lower interest rates. This is why nominal rates
        are often used in the industry (Vice versa for Discount)

```
-   Use this as a sense check on the values calculated -- whether or not
    it should be higher or lower

## Force of Interest

-   As the compounding frequency increases, we can see that both the
    interest and discount rates move towards the centre of the graph

-   If the **compounding frequency** $\mathbf{m}$**, tends to
    infinity**, both the discount and interest rates tend to a central
    rate as well, known as the **Force of Interest,** $\mathbf{\delta}$.
    It represents how much the fund accumulates at that **instantaneous
    time t**

### Dealing with Variable Force of Interest

-   Always find the **accumulation function FIRST**

-   Take note that the limits of integration $(0,t)$ is for a standard
    accumulation function $a_{0}(t)$. For a more general accumulation
    function $a_{k}(t - k)$ the limits would be $(k,t)$

-   Always consider logic when dealing with Variable Force -- the
    interest function should always be different for different years and
    periods

    -   When your start time is fixed, integrating from $(0,t)$ makes
        sense

    -   But when even the start time is not fixed (Yearly interest
        payments) then $(t,t + 1)$ would be better

    -   If you ever see a constant output while having a variable force,
        something is wrong

## Equivalent Rates

-   As alluded to earlier, if two funds have the same starting and
    ending values, they will have the **same Accumulation Function
    regardless which types of rates were used**

-   We get an all-in-one formula that we convert from one to another:

$$a(t) = (1 + i)^{t} = (1 - d)^{- t} = \left( 1 + \frac{i^{(m)}}{m} \right)^{m} = \left( 1 - \frac{d(m)}{m} \right)^{m} = e^{\delta t} = e^{\int_{0}^{t}{\delta_{r}\ dr}} = v^{- t}$$

**There is no equivalent Compound -- Simple Interest rate.**

-   We can convert between simple interest rates across time periods
    using the same principle -- equating accumulation functions

-   The conversion will simplify to become just multiplying by a factor
    to convert the rate

# [Chapter 2: Level Annuities]{.underline}

## Types of Annuities

-   An annuity is a series of **level payments at equal intervals**

-   Our goal is determining the **Present or Future Value** of the
    Annuity. It is the **SUM** of the Present or Future value of
    **EVERY** payment

-   There are two main types of annuities:

    -   **Immediate** → Payments made at the **end of the period
        (Arrears)**

        -   We denote the PV as $a_{n⏋i}$ and FV as $s_{n⏋i}$

    -   **Due** → Payments are made at the **start of the period
        (Advance)**

        -   We denote the PV as ${\ddot{a}}_{n⏋i}$ and FV as
            ${\ddot{s}}_{n⏋i}$

-   We calculate the **PV at the start of the first period** and the
    **FV at the end of the last period**, regardless of the type of
    Annuity

    -   $a_{n⏋i}$ is calculated **one period before the first the
        payment** while $s_{n⏋i}$ is calculated **on the period of the
        last payment**

    -   Conversely, ${\ddot{a}}_{n⏋i}$ is calculated on the **period of
        the first payment** while ${\ddot{s}}_{n⏋i}$ is calculated **one
        period after the last payment**

    -   Notice how both are symmetrical on a timeline:

**Important:**

-   Remember that the **start of the period is also the end of the
    previous period**. This means that given any set of Cashflows, we
    can **treat it as either an Immediate or Due**, depending on the
    comparison date we want to use

-   The cashflows above are one cycle above for illustration purposes to
    drive home the idea that they have different comparison dates

## Deriving Annuity Formulas:

-   Since payments are level, we can **factorise out the common payments
    P** to make the expressions simpler. However, we have to multiply it
    back for our final answers

-   Effectively, this allows us to derive the formulas **assuming
    payments of 1**

## [Linking the two kinds of Annuities]{.underline}

-   The financial calculator naturally assumes that the Annuities we
    calculate are Annuity Immediate (Need to convert for Due)

-   If we know how to convert Immediate to Due, we can simply use the
    calculator and apply the conversion which will save a lot of time

-   Both methods are viable, but usually the first method is easier and
    more direct. But the magic of the second approach is that it **does
    not require you to know the interest rate**

### Via the payment amount

-   If we compare the payments for Immediate and Due, we see the
    regardless FV or PV, the payments for Annuity Due are **always
    greater by a factor of** $\left( \mathbf{1 + i} \right)$

-   Thus, we can go from Immediate to Due by multiplying $(1 + i)$

    -   ${\ddot{a}}_{n⏋i} = (1 + i)a_{n⏋i}$

    -   ${\ddot{s}}_{n⏋i} = (1 + i)s_{n⏋i}$

-   Alternatively, we can also use this by **changing the payment amount
    by** $\left( \mathbf{1 + i} \right)$ in the calculator to directly
    calculate Annuity Due

### Via the number of payments

-   The difference between the two is that an **Annuity Due has
    additional payment at time 0** and **one less payment at time**
    $\mathbf{n}$

-   Opposite effects on both because they are comparing in different
    time periods

-   Given any series of cashflows, we can convert between the two by:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   **Present Value**

    -   **Additional payment at time 0** → Add a one additional payment
        $( + 1)$

    -   **One less payment at time** $\mathbf{n}$ → Consider one less
        payment $\left( a_{n - 1⏋i} \right)$

    -   $\mathbf{\therefore}{\ddot{a}}_{n⏋i} = 1 + a_{n - 1⏋i}$

![](media/image2.emf){width="4.220833333333333in"
height="1.2145833333333333in"}

-   **Future Value**

    -   **Additional payment at time 0** → Consider additional payment
        $\left( s_{n + 1⏋i} \right)$

    -   **One less payment at time** $\mathbf{n}$ → Subtract one less
        payment $( - 1)$

    -   $\therefore$ ${\ddot{s}}_{n⏋i} = s_{n + 1⏋i} - 1$

**Easy way to remember**

-   Annuity Due is always the subject the equation; Annuity Immediate is
    not

-   If the RHS time is PLUS/MINUS then the it must be MINUS/PLUS 1
    (Opposite)

## [Special Annuity Cases]{.underline}

### Deferred Annuities

-   Variant where the annuity is deferred and **starts at some later
    date** (not time 0)

-   We denote the present value of an annuity deferred by m periods as
    $_{m|}^{\ }a_{n⏋i}$

#### Calculating Values Deferred Annuities

-   **Standard Method**

    -   If we already know the PV/FV of the normal annuity (Any of the 4
        times) we can simply discount that value to the time we want

    -   $_{m|}^{\ }a_{n⏋i} = v^{m}*{\ddot{a}}_{n⏋i}$ (Or any of the
        other values)

-   **Differences in Annuities**

    -   Consider the cashflows involved in terms of their raw equation

    -   We can take a larger annuity minus a smaller annuity to obtain
        the deferred annuity that we want

#### Calculating values in the middle of the annuity payments

-   All our previous formulas helped us to find the value of the annuity
    at the start or end

-   We have no formula to help us to find the value of the annuity in
    the **middle of it**

-   Similarly, we can use either:

    -   **Simple method** → Accumulate discount a value from the
        start/end respectively

    -   **Sum of annuities**

        -   Split the annuity into two at the period we want to compare

        -   This artificially creates two annuities with end points at
            the time we want to compare, allowing us to sum together
            their values to obtain the value of the overall annuity

### Balloon & Drop Payments

-   Sometimes instead of finding PV/FV, we are tasked to find the number
    of payments

-   Since this is a calculated value, we often **got non-integer
    values** (EG. 15.42). This means that there are **15 standard
    payments and a fractional payment**

    -   **Balloon Payment** → Combine the last standard and fractional
        payment together

    -   **Drop Payment** → Treat the fractional payment as its own
        payment

Let $X$ be the fractional payment:

$$\mathbf{Balloon\ Payment} = P + X$$

$$PV_{Balloon} = \ a_{n⏋i} + X*v^{n}$$

$$\mathbf{Drop\ Payment} = X(1 + i)\ $$

$$PV_{Drop} = \ a_{n⏋i} + X(1 + i)*v^{n + 1}$$

-   Since the fractional payment was treated as its own payment in the
    **next period,** we have **to account for the time value of money**
    and accumulate it accordingly

### Varying Interest Rates

-   So far, we have used just one fixed effective rate to discount or
    accumulate annuities

-   More realistically, interest rates are bound to change across
    periods

-   Assume that we have [two periods]{.underline} with rates
    $i_{1}\ \&\ i_{2},\ i_{1} \neq i_{2}$. There are two methods to use:

-   **Market Portfolio Method:**

    -   **End of Period 1** → Accumulate first payment by
        $\left( 1 + i_{1} \right)$

    -   **End of Period 2** → Accumulate both payments by
        $\left( 1 + i_{2} \right)$

    -   **Result** →
        $FV = \ P\left( 1 + i_{1} \right)\left( 1 + i_{2} \right) + P\left( 1 + i_{2} \right)$

-   **Yield-Curve Method:**

    -   **End of Period 1** → Accumulate first payment by
        $\left( 1 + i_{1} \right)$

    -   **End of Period 2** → Accumulate payments by
        $\left( 1 + i_{1} \right)$ and $\left( 1 + i_{2} \right)$
        respectively

    -   **Result** →
        $FV = P\left( 1 + i_{1} \right)^{2} + P\left( 1 + i_{2} \right)$

-   Market Portfolio is more intuitive. The key difference is how the
    interest of the first payment (More generally, all previous periods)
    is treated

    -   **Market Portfolio** accumulates according to **rate of the
        current period**

    -   **Yield Curve** accumulates according to the **rate when that
        payment was made**

-   We can know which method to use based on how the question defines
    interest rates, be it according to the time of payment or prevailing
    period

-   Either way, we will need to manually map out each payment and
    discount/accumulate them according to their corresponding interest
    rates

## Continuous Annuities

-   Instead of making payments at fixed time intervals like the start or
    end of the period, payments are made **continuously throughout the
    period**, totalling up to the same amount

-   Similarly, we denote the PV/FV of such payments with
    ${\overline{a}}_{n⏋i}$ and ${\overline{s}}_{n⏋i}$

# [Chapter 2.5: Non-level Annuities]{.underline}

## Geometric Annuities

-   Payments change according to a Geometric Series (By a common factor
    $k$)

### Deriving Geometric Formula (Immediate)

-   Since the original annuity proof **already made use of the Geometric
    series**, increasing payments by a geometrically simply just changes
    the factor we use in the proof

$$PV_{Geometric} = \ v + (1 + k)v^{2} + \ldots(1 + k)^{n - 1}v^{n}$$

$$PV_{Geometric} = v\left\lbrack 1 + (1 + k)v + \ldots + \left( (1 + k)v \right)^{n - 1} \right\rbrack$$

$$PV_{Geometric} = v\left\lbrack \frac{1 - (1 + k)^{n}v^{n}}{1 - (1 + k)v} \right\rbrack$$

$$PV_{Geometric} = v\left\lbrack \frac{1 - \left( \frac{1 + k}{1 + i} \right)^{n}}{1 - \frac{1 + k}{1 + i}} \right\rbrack$$

$$PV_{Geometric} = v\left\lbrack \frac{1 - \left( \frac{1 + k}{1 + i} \right)^{n}}{\frac{i - k}{1 + i}} \right\rbrack$$

$$PV_{Geometric} = \frac{1 - \left( \frac{1 + k}{1 + i} \right)^{n}}{i - k}$$

-   This only holds for $i \neq k$, **derive the formula manually
    again** to see the interaction. The terms will cancel each other,
    **becoming a standard summation problem**

-   If k is negative, remember that the denominator nets out to become a
    plus instead

## Converting non-level to Level

-   Looking at the proof, we notice that it is **VERY similar to the
    level version**

-   Since the Financial Calculator only allows level payments,
    **converting a non-level annuity to a level one** would save us a
    lot of time

-   The key is noticing that we can substitute the common factors for
    each other:

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| $$\mathbf{i > k}$$                | $$\mathbf{i < k}$$                |
+===================================+===================================+
| $$(1                              | $$(1                              |
| + k)v = \frac{1 + k}{1 + i} < 1$$ | + k)v = \frac{1 + k}{1 + i} > 1$$ |
|                                   |                                   |
| $$v^{'} = \frac{1 + k}{1 + i}$$   | $$                                |
|                                   | 1 + i^{'} = \frac{1 + k}{1 + i}$$ |
| $$                                |                                   |
| 1 + i^{'} = \frac{1 + i}{1 + k}$$ | $$                                |
|                                   | i^{'} = \frac{1 + k}{1 + i} - 1$$ |
| $$                                |                                   |
| i^{'} = \frac{1 + i}{1 + k} - 1$$ |                                   |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

-   Depending on the relative magnitude of $i$ and $k$, we can determine
    if the factor is closer to the Present Value, or the Future Value
    formula & choose the appropriate conversion

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   When converting from FV to PV (vice versa), **remember to use**
    $\left( \mathbf{1 +}\mathbf{i}^{\mathbf{'}} \right)$ not $(1 + i)$

-   This method is preferred when we have to **solve for** $\mathbf{i}$
    **or** $\mathbf{k}$ as it simplifies the algebra. When solving for
    $i'$ or $v'$, **do not be alarmed by weird results**

## Arithmetic Annuities

-   Payments change according to an Arithmetic Progression (By fixed
    constant Q)

-   **Be careful when using AP Formula** -- The formula **assumes the
    first payment occurs at time is 1**, but sometimes your payments
    start at time 0 so an **adjustment is needed**

### Deriving Arithmetic Formula (Immediate)

-   **ALWAYS split up the payments** into their individual components to
    better visualize it

-   We notice that we can form several different level annuities:

    -   One level annuity with $n$ payments of $P$

    -   $j - 1$ **deferred** level annuities with $n - j$ payments of
        $Q$

-   We consider the PV at time 0:

$$PV_{Arithmetic} = P*a_{n⏋i} + Q*\sum_{j = 1}^{n - 1}{v^{j}*\frac{1 - v^{n - j}}{i}}$$

$$PV_{Arithmetic} = \ P*a_{n⏋i} + Q*\sum_{j = 1}^{n - 1}\frac{v^{j} - v^{n}}{i}$$

$$PV_{Arithmetic} = \ P*a_{n⏋i} + Q\left( \sum_{j = 1}^{n - 1}\frac{v^{j}}{i} - \frac{nv^{n}}{i} \right)$$

$$PV_{Arithmetic} = \ P*a_{n⏋i} + Q\left( \frac{a_{n⏋i}}{i} - \frac{nv^{n}}{i} \right)$$

$$PV_{Arithmetic} = a_{n⏋i}\left( P + \frac{Q}{i} \right) - \frac{Qnv^{n}}{i}$$

-   Using the Financial Calculator, we can quickly calculate this value
    by setting $\left( P + \frac{Q}{i} \right)$ as the Payment and
    $\left( \frac{Qnv^{n}}{i} \right)$ as the Future Value

-   Understanding this proof is important as this **concept of splitting
    annuities is extremely important** when dealing with Arithmetic
    Annuities

### Special case: Unit Increasing

-   When $P = Q = 1$. The condition can be met **for any**
    $\mathbf{P = Q = x,}$ as we can simply factor out $x$ to obtain
    $P = Q = 1$, but **remember to multiply back** $\mathbf{x}$

-   First payment starts out at 1 and increases by 1 each period
    **until** $\mathbf{n}$ in the last period

When $P = Q = 1,$

$$(Ia)_{n⏋i} = \ a_{n⏋i} + \left( \frac{a_{n⏋i}}{i} - \frac{nv^{n}}{i} \right)$$

$$(Ia)_{n⏋i} = \frac{i*a_{n⏋i} + a_{n⏋i} - nv^{n}}{i}\ $$

$$(Ia)_{n⏋i} = \frac{a_{n⏋i}(1 + i) - nv^{n}}{i}$$

$$(Ia)_{n⏋i} = \frac{{\ddot{a}}_{n⏋i} - nv^{n}}{i}$$

### Special case: Unit Decreasing

-   When $P = n$ and $Q = - 1$

-   First payment starts out at $n$ and decreases by 1 each period
    **until 1** in the last period

When $P = n,\ Q = - 1,$

$$(Da)_{n⏋i} = n*a_{n⏋i} - \left( \frac{a_{n⏋i}}{i} - \frac{nv^{n}}{i} \right)$$

$$(Da)_{n⏋i} = n*\left( \frac{1 - v^{n}}{i} \right) - \left( \frac{a_{n⏋i}}{i} - \frac{nv^{n}}{i} \right)$$

$$(Da)_{n⏋i} = \frac{\begin{array}{r}
n \\
\left( 1 - v^{n} \right) - \left( a_{n⏋i} - nv^{n} \right) \\
\end{array}}{i}$$

$$(Da)_{n⏋i} = \frac{n - nv^{n} - a_{n⏋i} + nv^{n}}{i}$$

$$(Da)_{n⏋i} = \frac{n - a_{n⏋i}}{i}$$

## Continuously Increasing Annuities

-   Annuities that **increase continuously** rather than at discrete
    times

-   Rate of payment can be described as a **function of** $\mathbf{t}$
    (Since $t$ is always increasing as well)

### Deriving Continuously increasing Annuities

-   Similar to the level version, we integrate the payments and the
    accumulation function:

$$\left( \overline{Ia} \right)_{n⏋i} = \ \int_{0}^{n}{f(t)*e^{\delta t}\ dt}$$

$$PV = \ \int_{0}^{n}{f(t)*e^{\int_{0}^{t}{\delta_{r}\ dr}}\ dt}$$

**Tabular integration**:

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Differentiate**                   **Integrate**
  ----------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------
  $$f(t)$$                            $$\int_{}^{}e^{\delta t}$$

  $$f^{'}(t)$$                        $$\int_{}^{}{\int_{}^{}e^{\delta t}}$$

  $$\vdots$$                          $$\vdots$$

  $$1$$                               $$\int_{}^{}{\ldots\int_{}^{}e^{\delta t}}$$
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Perpetuities

-   Annuities whose payments **go on forever** (No end date)

-   All formulas can be derived by letting
    $\mathbf{n \rightarrow \infty}$

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

#### Important concepts for Perpetuities

-   **The difference between two perpetuities is always an Annuity**.
    Since both payments go on forever, the **difference is simply when
    they start**

-   The present value of a Perpetuity **at any time** is always the
    same. This is because the payments go forever, so it **doesn't
    matter when it starts**

-   We can approximate Perpetuities in the TVM by setting the **number
    of years to be 9999,** which is sufficiently large to approximate
    such cashflows

## [Other Important Annuity Patterns]{.underline}

### Block Payments (For any increase/decrease -- very powerful concept)

-   Annuities that pay out in blocks. Payments within blocks are the
    same but each block has a different set of payments

-   We can treat each block as a deferred annuity, but a faster way is
    to add/subtract them

-   If we **start from the date furthest** from the comparison date and
    add the **change in payment levels,** the final result is the PV/FV
    of the entire annuity

height="2.222916666666667in"}

### Repeat Reverse Annuities (For increases/decreases of 1)

-   Annuities that start of increasing, reach a peak, and decrease back
    to the start

-   We could split into an increasing and decreasing annuity, but
    another faster method would be to **recognise that they are all the
    same deferred annuity**:

![Chart, timeline Description automatically generated with medium
confidence](media/image4.png){width="6.268055555555556in"
height="3.08125in"}

### Odd-Even Split (For alternating increases)

-   Annuities that follow a cyclical pattern (Increase in odd and
    decrease in even years)

-   We can **split them into a level annuity and an increasing annuity**
    **with different intervals:**

height="0.9333333333333333in"}

### Annuities into Perpetuities:

#### Decreasing Annuity into a Perpetuity:

-   Annuities that decrease till a certain level then becomes a level
    perpetuity

-   We could treat each block as a decreasing annuity and deferred
    perpetuity

-   But a faster way would be to treat them as a **perpetuity and unit
    decreasing annuity**:

$$PV = \frac{k}{i} + (Da)_{\overline{n - k}⅂i}$$

$$PV = \frac{k}{i} + \frac{n - k + a_{\overline{n}⅂i}}{i}$$

$$PV = \frac{n + a_{\overline{n}⅂i}}{i}$$

#### Increasing Annuity into perpetuity

-   Annuities that increase till a certain level then become a level
    perpetuity

-   We could treat each block as an increasing annuity then deferred
    perpetuity

-   But a faster way would be to treat them as the **difference of Unit
    Increasing Perpetuities**:

$$PV = (Ia)_{\overline{\infty}⅂i} - v^{n}(Ia)_{\overline{\infty}⅂i}$$

$$PV = (Ia)_{\overline{\infty}⅂i}\left( 1 - v^{n} \right)$$

$$PV = \left( \frac{1}{i} + \frac{1}{i^{2}} \right)\left( 1 - v^{n} \right)$$

$$PV = \left( \frac{1 + i}{i^{2}} \right)\left( 1 - v^{n} \right)$$

$$PV = \frac{1}{i}*\frac{1 - v^{n}}{d}$$

$$PV = \frac{{\ddot{a}}_{\overline{n}⅂i}}{i}$$

height="2.3256944444444443in"}

### Annuities with unknown number of payments

-   Annuities that can be split into different smaller annuities

-   We could treat it as one large annuity, but we may not have all the
    information needed (Typically, this is used for questions where $n$
    is not stated)

-   But a faster method would be to treat each section as its own
    Annuity (Based on what information we know) and then discount them
    accordingly:

$$a_{3n⏋i} = a_{n⏋i} + v^{n}*a_{n⏋i} + v^{2n}*a_{n⏋i}$$

$$a_{Xn⏋i} = a_{n⏋i} + v^{n}*a_{n⏋i} + v^{2n}*a_{n⏋i} + \ldots v^{Xn}*a_{n⏋i}$$

## Matching Payment and Interest frequencies

-   For us to use ALL of the above annuity formulas, the rates we use
    MUST MATCH the frequency of the payments (EG. Monthly interest with
    Monthly Payments)

-   If they are not in sync, we have two methods to make them sync

    -   **Converting Interest Rates**

        -   Using the principle of Equivalent Rates (Chapter 1)

        -   Generally preferred, but not applicable for symbolic
            questions

    -   **Converting Payments**

        -   Lower to higher payment frequency → Expand payments

        -   Higher to lower payment frequency → Collapse payments

### Lower to Higher payment frequency

-   Payments occur **less frequently** than the effective rate given

    -   EG. Quarterly Payments but Monthly Interest → **Convert to
        monthly payment**

-   We can split the payments into $k$ smaller payments of $X$ to be
    aligned with the given rate

-   We must keep the PV/FV of these payments to be equal to the original
    payment. We can use the level annuity formulas to calculate the
    smaller payment $X$

-   Since $X$ matches the given rates, we can use both in our annuity
    formulas

### Higher to Lower payment frequency

-   Payments occur more frequently than the effective rate given

    -   EG. Monthly payments but yearly interest given → Convert to
        Yearly payment

-   We can combine $k$ smaller payments into one payment of $X$ be
    aligned with the given rate

-   We must keep the PV/FV of these payments to be equal to the original
    payment. We can use the level annuity formulas to calculate the
    larger payment $X$

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Since $X$ matches the given rates, we can use both in our annuity
    formulas

#### Deriving Formulas

We first show the equivalent rates:

$$\left( 1 + i^{(m)} \right)^{k} = (1 + i)$$

$$i = \left( 1 + i^{(m)} \right)^{k} - 1$$

We then accumulate to the end of the period:

$$X = P*s_{n⏋i}$$

$$X = \ P*\frac{\left( 1 + i^{(m)} \right)^{k} - 1}{i^{(m)}}$$

$$X = P*\frac{i}{i^{(m)}}$$

$$PV = X*a_{n⏋i}$$

$$PV = \ P*\frac{i}{i^{(m)}}*a_{n⏋i}$$

# [Chapter 3: Spot, Forward and Interest Swaps]{.underline}

## Spot & Forward Rates

-   Rates offered are likely to change in accordance with the
    **investment horizon.** Different periods of investment will result
    in different rates

-   There are two main kinds of rates:

    -   **Spot** $\left( \mathbf{s}_{\mathbf{t}} \right)$**→** From
        **today to some future date** $\left( \mathbf{0\ to\ t} \right)$

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   **Forward** $\left( \mathbf{f}_{\mathbf{t - 1,t}} \right)$→ From a
    **future date to 1 year ahead**
    $\left( \mathbf{t - 1\ to\ t} \right)$

### Linking the two rates

-   Both rates are quoted **Annual Effective**. This is important for
    Spot rates, as it spans across more than one period:

    -   $a(t) \neq \left( 1 + s_{t} \right)$

    -   $a(t) = \left( 1 + s_{t} \right)^{t}$

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Using the concept of Equivalent Rates, we can convert between the
    two by:

    -   $\left( 1 + s_{t} \right)^{t} = \left( 1 + s_{t - 1} \right)^{t - 1}\left( 1 + f_{t} \right)$

    -   **OR**
        $\left( 1 + s_{t} \right)^{t} = \left( 1 + f_{1} \right)\left( 1 + f_{2} \right)\ldots\left( 1 + f_{t} \right)$

    -   By definition, $s_{1} \equiv f_{1}$

-   Using these formulas, we can form the accumulation function and
    solve cashflow problems using first principles by manually
    accumulating/discounting every cashflow

-   Forward Rates calculated this way are known as the **Implied
    Rates.** They are an **estimate** of what will be the **actual
    1-year spot rate during that time**, known as the Quoted Rates.
    Where possible, we should use the Quoted Rate over the implied
    forward rates.

### Forward rates lasting more than one period

-   They are like spot rates in the sense that they last more than one
    period. Thus, we can use the same principle of equivalent rates to
    calculate them:

    -   **Using spot rates:**
        $\left( 1 + s_{t + m} \right)^{t + m} = \left( 1 + s_{t} \right)^{t}*\left( 1 + f_{t,t + m} \right)^{m}$

    -   **Using forward rates:**
        $\left( 1 + f_{t,t + m} \right)^{m} = \left( 1 + f_{t,t + 1} \right)*\ldots\left( 1 + f_{t + m - 1,t + m} \right)$

-   Sometimes, we are given forward rates for cashflows that occur
    before the forward rate period. This means that we should assume the
    cashflow is **reinvested** at that forward rate and we should find
    the value after reinvestment

## Interest Rate Swaps

-   Two **counterparties** currently have two kinds of liabilities with
    different style of interests:

    -   Party A → Variable Interest

    -   Party B → Fixed Interest

-   Each party would now like the other style of payment for various
    reasons:

    -   Hedge against interest rates

    -   Predictability of payments

-   One solution would be to **Swap their interest payments.** However,
    since they can't directly swap their contract, they can achieve a
    similar outcome by paying for the other party:

    -   Party A will **pay the fixed rate** to party B (**Payer**)

    -   Party B will pay the variable rate to party A (**Receiver**)

### Swap Mechanics

-   Fixed payments will be made at a **constant Swap Rate**
    $\left( \mathbf{R} \right)$ at **periodic intervals** known as the
    **Settlement Period**

-   Variable payments will be made at the prevailing rates at the time,
    modelled by using the current **Forward Rates**
    $\left( \mathbf{f}_{\mathbf{n}} \right)$

-   Since both parties may not have identical principals, the payments
    are made according to some common **Notional Amount**
    $\left( \mathbf{X}_{\mathbf{n}} \right)$

    -   Constant Notional → **Level Swap**

    -   Increasing Notional → **Accreting Swap**

    -   Decreasing Notional → **Amortizing Swap**

To ensure that the deal is fair, the **PV of both Cashflows** must be
the same:

$$PV(Fixed\ Payments) = PV(Variable\ Payments)$$

$$\frac{X_{1}R}{\left( 1 + s_{1} \right)} + \ldots\frac{X_{n}R}{\left( 1 + s_{n} \right)^{n}} = \frac{X_{1}f_{1}}{\left( 1 + s_{1} \right)} + \ldots\frac{X_{n}f_{n}}{\left( 1 + s_{n} \right)^{n}}$$

### Deferred Swaps

-   Similar concept to a **Deferred Annuity.** However, when an SOA says
    $\mathbf{n}$**-year deferred**, $\mathbf{m}$**-year** interest rate
    swaps, the actual swap occurs for $\mathbf{n - m}$ **years** after
    $\mathbf{n}$ years

-   In other words, the **swap period defined by SOA includes the
    deferral as well**

### Level Swap Shortcuts

-   There are two shortcuts available for **Level Swaps.** If the swap
    is Accreting or Amortizing, we will have to perform the calculations
    manually

-   **The first shortcut is factoring out X**:

    -   If the swap is level, $X_{1} = X_{2} = \ldots = X_{n}$, which
        allows it to be factored out from both sides of the equation and
        cancelled

    -   This simplifies the calculation to just using the interest rates

-   **The second is to use the Bond pricing formula:**

    -   This method uses an entirely different approach to calculating
        the swap rate

    -   We **consider the net cashflows for Party A**, including their
        current obligation. We notice that the resulting cashflows looks
        very similar to that of a bond, thus we can make use of that
        formula to calculate R as well!

![](media/image9.png){width="6.268055555555556in"
height="4.055555555555555in"}

**Bond Pricing Formula:**

$$Price\ of\ Bond = PV(Coupon\ Payments) + PV(Principal)$$

$$X = \frac{XR}{\left( 1 + s_{1} \right)} + \ldots + \frac{XR}{\left( 1 + s_{n} \right)^{n}} + \frac{X}{\left( 1 + s_{n} \right)^{n}}$$

Since level swap, we can factorise & cancel out X:

$$1 = R\left( \frac{1}{\left( 1 + s_{1} \right)} + \ldots + \frac{1}{\left( 1 + s_{n} \right)^{n}} \right) + \frac{1}{\left( 1 + s_{n} \right)^{n}}$$

If it is a **deferred swap**, we all we need to do is to **discount the
LHS to the first period** as well.

## [Other Swap Calculations]{.underline}

### Net Swap Payments

-   Since both parties pay each other on the same day, it is redundant
    to make payments

-   Instead, it is more efficient for one party to just make a **Net
    Swap Payment** instead

-   It is important to **consider whose perspective we are taking**: An
    outflow for one party is an Inflow for another

### Net Interest Payment

-   We want to consider how much one party pays in total on the
    settlement date

-   There are two cashflows from their perspective:

    -   Net Swap Payment

    -   Original Interest Payment

-   The Net Interest Payment is simply the sum of these two cashflows,
    which is how much they end up paying in total

-   Similarly, it is also important to consider whose perspective when
    computing the net interest payment

## Market Value

-   One may choose to leave the position before the end of the Swap Term

-   In order to sell it to another person, we must know the market value
    of the contract

-   We can calculate it by computing the **Net** **Present Value of all
    future Net Swap Payments**

-   By definition, the Market Value of a contract at time 0 will be 0
    because $\mathbf{NPV = 0}$

    -   However, due to interest rates changing (Our projected forward
        rate not being the actual rate come the appropriate time), the
        **market value of the contract at some later time is not likely
        to be 0**

    -   We should always use the prevailing **Spot Rates** at the time
        we are calculating the market value instead of the forward rates
        we predicted in the past

-   It is important to consider whose perspective we are looking at, as
    one person's gain is another person's loss

## Why interest rate swaps?

-   Typically, the payer of the swap rate currently has an existing loan
    with interest payments based on some floating rate

-   The **payer** believes that interest rates will rise, hence wants to
    pay a fixed swap rate to **hedge against these rising interest
    rates**

-   The receiver believes that interest rates will fall, hence is
    willing to pay the lower variable rate

# [Chapter 4: Rates of Return]{.underline}

## [One Period Return Rates]{.underline}

### Time Weighted Rate of Return (TWRR)

Let R be sub-period return rate:

$$R_{n} = \frac{Balance\ before\ new\ transaction}{Balance\ after\ previous\ transaction} = \frac{B_{n}^{Before}}{B_{n - 1}^{After}}$$

Using the concept of equivalent rates, we can solve for the TWRR

$$\left( R_{1} \right)\left( R_{2} \right)\ldots\left( R_{n} \right) = \left( 1 + i_{TWRR} \right)$$

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Balance **before**       0                               $$B_{1}^{Before}$$               $$\ldots$$                   $$B_{n - 1}^{Before}$$               $$B_{n}^{After}$$   
  transaction                                                                                                                                                                     
  ------------------------ ------------------- ----------- -------------------- ----------- ------------ --------------- ------------------------ ----------- ------------------- ----

  (Injection/Withdrawal)

  transaction                                                                                                                                                                     

  Sub-period return rate                       $$R_{1}$$                        $$R_{2}$$                $$R_{n - 1}$$                            $$R_{n}$$                       
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Dollar Weighted Rate of Return (DWRR)

DWRR is essentially the **IRR of the fund**:

$$B_{Start}\left( 1 + i_{DWRR} \right)^{1} + CF_{1}\left( 1 + i_{DWRR} \right)^{\frac{11}{12}} + \ldots + CF_{n}\left( 1 + i_{DWRR} \right)^{\frac{(1 - n)}{n}} = B_{End}$$

-   However, as seen earlier, IRR is **numerically complicated** to
    compute

-   Thus, we consider a **Simple Interest Approximation** instead:

$$B_{Start}\left( 1 + i_{DWRR} \right) + CF_{1}\left( 1 + \frac{11}{12}i_{DWRR} \right) + \ldots + CF_{n}\left( 1 + \frac{(1 - n)}{n}i_{DWRR} \right) = B_{End}$$

$$i_{DWRR} = \frac{B_{End} - B_{Start} - \sum_{}^{}{CF_{t}}}{B_{Start} + \sum_{}^{}{CF_{t}(1 - t)}}$$

-   **For time spans of exactly one-year**, this simple interest
    approximation will be equivalent to the one-year IRR of the fund

    -   Can be verified using Desmos by plotting
        $y = \left( 1 + i_{IRR} \right)^{x}$ and
        $y = \left( 1 + i_{DWRR}x \right)$

    -   For any $i_{IRR}\  = i_{DWRR}$, the intersection point will
        always occur at $x = 1$

    -   Phrased another way, as long as $x = t = 1,$
        $i_{DWRR} = i_{IRR}$

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Notice that this formula is extremely **similar to the regular
    interest formula**. This means that **if the cashflows are
    sufficiently small**, the simple interest approximation method of
    DWRR can be used to estimate the true annual effective rate

**Note:** Investment Income refers to the interest earned on all the
cashflows during the period.

### Differences between each measure:

-   **TWRR** makes use of **Compound Interest** while **DWRR** uses
    **simple interest approximation**

-   **TWRR** is a measure of the **Fund Managers Performance**, while
    **DWRR** is a measure of the **Overall Performance of the Fund**

    -   TWRR removes the effect of the timing and additional
        transactions. This is similar to how a **fund manager does not
        control over when they receive funds and how much**, thus is
        used to approximate the fund manager performance

-   If DWRR \> TWRR, it means that the **timing** of
    deposits/withdrawals was very good -- **deposited right before a
    high growth period** after or **withdrawn before a crash**

### Different Timespans

-   The above formulas use timespans of **one year** to compute the
    rates

-   Thus, the calculated TWRR and DWRR are naturally assumed to be
    annual 1-year rate

-   However, some questions may specify a **different timespan** -- 6
    months or 2-year

    -   The most important thing is to MAINTAIN the formula

    -   For TWRR, maintain the LHS as just $(1 + i)$ and for DWRR, keep
        the coefficients of $i$ to be under 1 (Proportion till the end
        of the given time)

-   This way, the rates calculated will be the 6-month or 2-year rate

-   Using the **concept of equivalent rates**, we will need to convert
    these 6-month or 2-year rates into annual effective 1-year rates
    (**True TWRR/DWRR)**

## [Multiple periods return rates]{.underline}

### Arithmetic Mean

-   Given multiple one period returns
    $\left( R_{1}\ldots R_{n} \right)$, the arithmetic mean rate of
    return is the average of all of them

-   It is a measure of the **average fund performance if you were to
    hold it for one year.** Some say that this measure is **overly
    optimistic for long time horizons**

$$R_{Arithmetic} = \frac{R_{1} + \ldots R_{n}}{n}$$

### Geometric Mean (AKA Cumulative Annual Growth Rate -- CAGR)

-   Given multiple one period returns
    $\left( R_{1}\ldots R_{n} \right)$, the geometric mean rate of
    return is the annualized effective rate of all of them

-   It is a measure of the **expected annualized rate if you were to
    hold it for** $\mathbf{n}$ **years.** Some say that this is **overly
    pessimistic for short time horizons**

$$\left( 1 + R_{1} \right)\ldots\left( 1 + R_{n} \right) = \left( 1 + R_{Geometic} \right)^{n}$$

Important: To find the variance of these return rates, we should use the
**Sample Variance formula**:

$$s^{2} = \frac{1}{n - 1}\sum_{}^{}\left( r_{i} - \overline{r} \right)$$

## [Discounted Cashflow Analysis]{.underline}

### Net Present Value (NPV)

-   It is the **difference between the PV of Cash Inflows and
    Outflows**. It thus measures the raw value created for the firm

-   $NPV = PV(Inflows) - PV(Outflows)$

### Internal Rate of Return (IRR)

-   The required **interest rate that makes the NPV of a project zero**.
    It represents the annual rate of return that will be earned

-   $NPV = 0 \rightarrow Solve\ for\ i\ using\ Financial\ Calc$

    -   Can also be used to **solve quadratic equations** involving $v$

## [Other Measures of Return (FNCE101)]{.underline}

### Dollar Returns

-   A measure of the **absolute return** on an investment over a period
    of time

-   Poor measure of return since there is no indication if it is high or
    low

$$Dollar\ Return = Income\ from\ Investment + Capital\ Gain\ or\ Loss$$

### Percentage Return

-   Measure of the **percentage return** on an investment over a period
    of time

-   Better measure as it considers the beginning values of the assets

$$Percentage\ Return = Dividend\ Yield + Capital\ Gain\ Yield$$

$$Percentage\ Return = \frac{Dividend}{Beginning\ Price} + \frac{Capital\ Gain\ or\ Loss}{Beginning\ Price}$$

# [Chapter 5: Loans]{.underline}

## What is a loan?

-   When we borrow money from the bank or another company, we are taking
    a **Loan**

-   The **outstanding loan balance earns interest**, increasing the
    amount we have to pay for each period we do not fully repay the loan

-   We consider the standard scenario where loans are **repaid at level
    amounts at regular intervals** (Forming a Level Annuity)

    -   Like all other problems we have dealt with till now, the key
        principle is that the*\
        *$$\mathbf{PV}\left( \mathbf{Loan\ Amount} \right)\mathbf{= PV}\left( \mathbf{Loan\ Payments} \right)$$

-   There are two components to each loan repayment:

    -   Interest repaid

    -   Principal repaid

-   Each repayment made will **first pay off any interest earned so
    far**, and the **remaining amount will pay off the principal**

-   We are interested in calculating the not only the repayment amount
    but the **various components of the loan** at each time to better
    understand the status of Debt

-   $B_{t}$ to denote the **Outstanding Balance,** where $B_{0}$ is the
    principal

-   $R_{t}$ to denote the **Repayment Amount** (Assumed to be Constant)

-   $I_{t}$ to denote the amount that was used to pay off **Interest**

-   $P_{t}$ to denote the amount that was used to pay off the
    **principal**

### [Three ways to Calculate Outstanding Loan Balance]{.underline}

#### Recursive Method

Using first principals and manually calculating the change in each
period:

$$B_{t} = B_{t - 1} - P_{t}$$

$$B_{t} = B_{t - 1} + I_{t} - R$$

$$B_{t} = B_{t - 1} + B_{t - 1}*i - R$$

$$B_{t} = B_{t - 1}(1 + i) - R$$

Applying recursion,

$$B_{t} = \left( B_{t - 2}(1 + i) - R \right)(1 + i) - R$$

$$\vdots$$

$$B_{t} = B_{0}(1 + i)^{t} - R - \ldots R(1 + i)^{t - 1}$$

$$B_{t} = B_{0}(1 + i)^{t} - R*s_{n⏋i}$$

#### Retrospective Method

The outstanding balance is the Time adjusted **difference of the
principal & what was already paid**:

$$B_{t} = B_{0}(1 + i)^{t} - R*s_{n⏋i}$$

-   Notice that this is the **same result as the Recursive Method**;
    they are the same

#### Prospective Method

The outstanding balance is the **PV of all future loan payments**:

$$B_{t} = R*a_{n - t\ ⏋i}$$

-   Note that this method can also be used if we have a future loan
    balance as well

-   By discounting the **Future Loan Balance** and **any payments**
    **between then and the current time**, we obtain the Current Loan
    Balance

All three methods are equivalent and will lead to the same results. We
need to know all three because it **depends on what information the
question gives us**. It is faster to use a particular method if the
question has already given us the relevant information.

### Loan Amortization

-   In finance, Amortization means to **spread payments** (of a Loan, in
    this case)

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   The goal is to create an **Amortization Schedule** that shows how
    each **Repayment** is used to pay off both the **Interest** and
    **Principal in each period**, slowly reducing our **Outstanding
    Balance** to 0 at the end of the Loan

-   For simplicity, we factor out all payments to 1 (Similar to our
    Annuity Proofs). Remember to **multiply by the payment amount** for
    actual questions

#### Recursive/Retrospective Schedule

-   Using the Recursive Method, we can determine each component in any
    given period

-   However, this method is **best done in Excel** when the calculations
    can be performed quickly. For the exam, this **may not be the best
    method**

#### Prospective Schedule

-   Using the prospective method instead, we notice that the Loan
    Balance forms an Annuity

-   Using this Annuity formula, we can see how the schedule becomes
    simplified:

+-------+-----------+---------------+---------------+-----------------+

-   From this insight, we can see that **all we need is the interest
    rate** and **repayment** amount to identify any component

-   If we are given the **principal repaid in one period**, we can use
    the **accumulate or discount** it accordingly to find the principal
    repaid in another

-   Principal Payments are proportional --
    $\frac{Principal_{t}}{Principal_{t + 2}} = \frac{Principal_{t + n}}{Principal_{t + n + 2}} = v^{2}$

-   The principal payments can also be viewed in a **timeline:**

#### Varying Interest Rates

-   If interest rates change midway, the **remaining schedule has to be
    changed** as well

-   In particular, we have to **recalculate the remaining number of
    payments needed.** Using this, we can calculate the remaining loan
    balance after the interest rate change

-   However, the **shortcut method still works -- just use the
    appropriate interest rates at the time when they change**

## [Other Payment Patterns]{.underline}

### Level Principal Payments

-   Instead of having level overall payments, this method of payment
    ensures that the **principle decreases by a flat amount** in each
    period

    -   We can determine the amount at which it decreases by taking the
        **loan balance divided by the number of remaining payments**

-   Given this information, we are able to **easily calculate the
    outstanding balance**, and thus the **Interest payment** and
    subsequently the **overall repayment amount each period**

$$Principal\ Repayment\ each\ period = \frac{B_{0}}{n}$$

$$Outstanding\ Balance\ each\ period = \frac{n - t + 1}{n}B_{0}$$

$$Total\ Repayment\ each\ period = i\left( \frac{n - t}{n} \right)B_{0} + \frac{B_{0}}{n}$$

-   It is important to note that the **outstanding loan balance forms a
    decreasing arithmetic progression**. We can make use of this to
    easily calculate total interest and hence total amount paid:

    -   $Total\ Interest = i*\left( B_{0} + B_{1} + B_{2} + \ldots 0 \right)$

    -   $Sum\ of\ Arithmetic\ progression = \frac{N}{2}(First\ Term + Last\ Term)$

    -   $Total\ Amount\ Paid = Total\ Interest + Loan\ Amount$

-   **A few key insights:**

    -   Since the **outstanding balance falls each period**, the
        interest falls each period as well. This means that the
        **repayments fall each period**

    -   The repayment amount will be **initially higher** than the flat
        repayment amount, but will fall and become smaller than it

    -   Since the total repayment amount falls over time, this means
        that you will **pay lesser compared to the typical method**

### Non-Level Payments

-   Payments that follow an **arithmetic or geometric annuity**

-   Use their respective PV/FV formulas to **find the loan balance at
    every time**

-   With the various loan balances, we should focus on using the
    **recursive method**:

    -   $Balance_{t + 1} = Balance_{t} - P_{t + 1}$

    -   $P_{t + 1} = \ Balance_{t + 1} - \ Balance_{t}$

-   Questions may look the same, but the **approach is completely
    different**

-   If the question has a **balloon/drop payment involved**, always
    calculate the remaining balance in the **period before the
    balloon/drop**. Then **ROLL FORWARD the balance** to obtain the
    Ballooned or Dropped Payment

### Missing or Additional Payments

-   The general schedule above assumes that payments are made every
    period. However, if **payments are missed or additional payments are
    made**, then the Loan will take **longer/shorter to amortize**

    -   If payments are **missed**, then the Loan balance at the end of
        the usual loan period will still be positive → **How much?**

    -   If **additional payments** were made, then the Loan Balance will
        hit 0 before the usual loan period → **How Much/When?**

-   In either case, we can easily visualize the problem by **drawing out
    the timeline** to better visualize the problem

| We then use **Retrospective       |                                   |

| remaining Loan Balance instead.   |                                   |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

### Payments that scale with Interest

-   Some loan payments will **scale based on the interest amount**

    -   EG. Equal to 100% of interest payments. 150% of interest
        payments etc.

-   There are some special insights to take note of:

    -   **100% of interest** → No principal is repaid; loan balance
        stays the same

    -   **150% of interest** → Balance falls by $(150 - 100)\%*Interest$
        every period

    -   $\mathbf{90\%}$ **of interest** → Balance increases by
        $(100 - 90)\%*Interest$ every period

### Other situations:

-   **Different Interest Rates for Interest payments and discount** →
    Draw timeline

-   **Cost of loan** → Reduces the principal amount to control the yield
    rate

# [Chapter 6: Bonds and Stocks]{.underline}

## What is a Bond?

-   A bond is a special type of **Loan:** The party who issues the bond
    (Bond Issuer) borrows money from the party who purchases the bought
    the bond (Bond Investor)

-   However, Bonds have a **different payment structure**:

    -   **Every period** → **Coupon payments**

        -   These coupon payments are based off interest on the **Face
            Amount/Par Value** of the bond, which is simply a notional
            amount for calculations

    -   **Last period** → **Redemption Value**

        -   If not specified otherwise, the Redemption value is **equal
            to the Face Amount/Par Value.** It is **paid** **on-top** of
            the coupon payment

-   Thus, unlike a Loan who has Interest and Principal payments every
    period, Bonds repay the interest every period and **only repays the
    principal at the end in a lump sum**

## Bond Valuation

Let us use the following notations:

-   $\mathbf{P}$ is the **Price of the Bond**

-   $\mathbf{r}$ is the **Coupon Rate** (Quoted Annual Nominal Rate)

-   $\mathbf{F}$ is the **Face Amount**

-   $\mathbf{C}$ is the **Call Value**/**Redemption Value**

-   $\mathbf{i}$ is the interest rate equivalent to **Yield to
    Maturity** (Quoted Annual Nominal Rate)

$$Bond\ Price = PV(Coupons) + PV(Redemption\ Value)$$

$$\mathbf{\therefore P = Fr*}\mathbf{a}_{\mathbf{n⏋i}}\mathbf{+ C*}\mathbf{v}^{\mathbf{n}}$$

## Dirty Prices

-   When valuing a Bond, we typically assume that the bond is being
    valued **6-months or 1-year intervals** from the issue date. Prices
    valued this way are known as the **Quoted Price**

-   However, if we purchase a Bond, it is likely that we will buying
    **it in between valuation dates**. We will thus have to adjust the
    price, known as the **Dirty Price**

-   The idea is that we must **compensate the previous bondholder** for
    the additional time after the previous coupon payment by paying him
    a **corresponding portion of the Coupon**

$$\mathbf{Dirty\ Price} = Quoted\ Price + Accrued\ Interest$$

$$\mathbf{Accrued\ Interest} = \frac{Number\ of\ Days\ since\ Coupon}{Number\ of\ days\ between\ Coupons}*Coupon$$

$$\mathbf{Alternative\ Dirty\ Price} = Quoted\ Price*(1 + i)^{\frac{Number\ of\ Days\ since\ Coupon}{Number\ of\ days\ between\ Coupons}}$$

## Bond Premium & Discount

We recall the Annuity Immediate formula:

$$a_{n⏋i} = \frac{1 - v^{n}}{i}$$

$$v^{n} = 1 - i*a_{n⏋i}$$

Using this formula, we can **rewrite our Bond Price formula:**

$$P = Fr*a_{n⏋i} + C*v^{n}$$

$$P = Fr*a_{n⏋i} + C*\left( 1 - i*a_{n⏋i} \right)$$

$$P = Fr*a_{n⏋i} + C - Ci*a_{n⏋i}$$

$$P = C + (Fr - Ci)*a_{n⏋i}$$

-   Where $(Fr - Ci)*a_{n⏋i}$ is the Premium/Discount of the Bond

We consider the difference in the Price of the Bond & the Redemption
Value $P - C,$

## Bond Amortization

-   There are some **terminology differences** between Loan and Bonds:

    -   **Coupon Payment** → Repayment

    -   **Book Value** → Outstanding Balance

    -   **Write-up/down or Discount/Premium Amortization** → Principal
        Repaid

        -   Also known as the Accumulation of Discoumt/Premium

-   The goal is to create an Amortization Schedule that shows how each
    **Coupon Payment** is used to **offset the Premium/Discount** in
    each period, slowly bringing the **Book Value to the Redemption
    Value** (Usually equal to Par Value) at the end of the Loan

-   Similarly, each **coupon first pays off interest**, then the
    remaining amount is used to offset the premium/discount on the bond,
    which **decreases/increases the book value** to Par

-   All types of questions that apply to loans **ALSO apply to Bond
    Amortization!**

## [Special Type of Bonds]{.underline}

### Zero Coupon Bonds (Pure discount Bonds)

-   Bonds that do not pay coupons, only the redemption value at the back

-   Due to only having one cashflow at the end of $t$ periods, the yield
    of the zero-coupon bond is **essentially the Spot Rate** for that
    length of time. Thus, given the price of any zero-coupon bond, we
    can calculate the spot rate

-   However, we **may not be given a zero-coupon bond directly**. Like
    the interest rate swap shortcut, **by buying and selling regular
    bonds in a portfolio**, the **net cashflows per period may be
    zero**, essentially creating a zero-coupon bond.

### Floating Rate Bonds

-   Bonds whose **coupon rates vary with some external index.** Their
    values rise when interest rises as well, thus they **suffer less
    interest rate risk**

### Callable Bonds

-   Bonds where there is a **choice** to fully repay the bond on an
    earlier date instead

    -   Choosing to repay the Bond earlier is known as **Calling the
        Bond.** The redemption value at the time is known as the **Call
        Price**

    -   To ensure that the Investor is properly compensated for lost
        coupon payments if the Bond is called, the **Call Price is
        higher the earlier the Bond is called**

-   **Callable bonds** are good for Issuers, as their flexible nature
    allows them to **take advantage of falling interest rates** (Issue
    new one at lower cost) and allows them **to eliminate obligations at
    will** with the main disadvantage being the **higher Coupon Rates**

-   **Put Provisions** are good for Investors, but not issuer, as they
    may have to **buy back the bond at an unattractive price**, but they
    allow the issuer to use **lower coupon rates**

#### Scenario Testing

-   Callable Bond **cashflows are uncertain** as they are at the
    discretion of the Bond issuer

-   Thus, the main approach to work with Callable bonds is to **Scenario
    test -- Consider every possible outcome** at form an analysis from
    that

-   There are two main types:

    -   **Given Price, determine Yield**

        -   Use the Fin Calc to quickly reverse engineer the Yields for
            each scenario

        -   We focus on the **Lowest Yield -- Yield to Worst**

        -   This represents the worst-case scenario for the investor

    -   **Given Yield, determine Price**

        -   Use the Fin Calc to quickly reverse engineer to price for
            each scenario

        -   We focus on the **LOWEST Price -- Maximum amount they should
            pay**

        -   This represents the highest price an investor will have to
            pay to guarantee at least **Yield to Worst**, regardless
            which scenario ends up happening

            -   Price and Yield have an **inverse relationship**

            -   Thus, by choosing the lowest price, it means that even
                if another scenario were to occur, we would earn even
                higher than YTW

            -   It is also known as the **maximum price**, because if we
                increase price beyond this point, other scenarios may be
                fine, but this scenario will lead to a situation worse
                than YTW, that means that overall YTW is no longer
                guaranteed

    -   We can **eliminate scenarios to test by using the shortcuts:**

        -   YTW always occurs at the **end points** -- First & Last year
            that the **call price changes** (Including maturity)

        -   YTW is the **First end date for Premium** & **Last for
            Discount Bonds** for **each group** of call dates with the
            same call price

## Stock Valuation: Dividend Discount Model

-   Like all other financial instruments, we have seen so far, we can
    value a stock by taking the **Present Value of its future cashflows
    (Dividends)**

    -   If we **expect to sell the stock** in the future, we treat that
        as a cashflow as well

-   Since corporate lifespans are infinite, these dividend payments can
    occur infinitely, forming a **perpetuity.** Depending on the type of
    stock, Dividends may remain constant or continue to grow every
    period, forming a **growing perpetuity**

$$PV = \frac{D}{i - k} = \frac{D_{0}(1 + k)}{i - k}$$

-   The math behind the calculation is a simple application of the
    growing perpetuity concept

-   There are a few things to look out for:

    -   Questions may give you the **current** dividends paid. Since the
        dividends grows, we can find the time 1 dividend by multiplying
        by the growth factor

        -   Given the dividend or stock value at any one point of time,
            we can simply multiply it by the growth factor to determine
            the value at another time

    -   If the growth rate changes midway, we consider a **two-stage
        model**, which simply means we now have an **Annuity and
        Deferred Perpetuity**

# [Chapter 7: Bond Yield & Term Structure of Interest Rates]{.underline}

## [Measures of Bond Yield]{.underline}

### Current Yield & Nominal Yield

-   Simple measure of the potential return of the bond -- **How much**
    an investor would expect to make if they held the bond **for a
    year**

-   However, it is not an accurate reflection of the potential gain of
    the bond:

    -   It does not take into the time value of money

    -   It does not consider capital gain or loss (Discount/Premiums)

    -   It is based on Quoted Prices while the actual investment is
        Dirty Prices

$$Current\ Yield = \frac{\mathbf{Annual}\ Coupon\ Payments}{Quoted\ Price}$$

$$Nominal\ Yield = \frac{\mathbf{Annual}\ Coupon\ Payments}{Face\ value} = Coupon\ rate$$

### Yield to Maturity

-   When we price bonds, we are supposed to use **prevailing spot
    rates** at the time (Obtained from yield curve) for more accurate
    representation of the time value of money

-   However, in practice the **term structure is not observable**, but
    the **transaction prices are**. Thus, if we solve for the discount
    rate that sets the discounted cashflows to the transaction price, we
    obtain the **Yield to Maturity**

-   It is the **IRR for a bond** -- which measures the **average annual
    rate** we would receive on the bond should we **hold it to
    maturity.** It is a sort of **"weighted average" of the spot rates**

-   For this course, we assume the yield curve to be flat. Thus, the
    interest rate used to discount is constant, **thus is also the YTM**
    of the bond

-   However, there are some issues with using YTM to evaluate Bonds:

    -   There is **no closed form solution** for YTM. It can only be
        calculated using **numerical methods**

    -   Although YTM is an "average" of the spot rates, it also changes
        with the coupon rate, which makes it an **"impure" measure**

    -   It also **assumes** that the bond will be held to **maturity
        (Most are traded)** as well as that the **coupons are reinvested
        (Interest on Interest)** at the same rate (Hard)

### Par Yield

-   An alternative measure is par yield, which is the **coupon rate that
    makes the bond trade at par** under the current term structure
    **(**$\mathbf{Price = Face = Call}$**)**

-   However, it is an **inaccurate measure** -- It is more of a
    **summary of the existing term** structure rather than measures of a
    potential return of a bond

### Holding Period Yield

-   Measure of the return we get by holding a bond for a period of time
    (Assuming it is redeemed at the end of the period)

-   Based on the **idea of interest --** It takes the difference between
    the ending value and starting value, accounting for any additional
    income (Coupons) as well

$$P_{0}(1 + i)^{t} = P_{t} + FV(Coupons)$$

Solve for $i$ as the t-period holding period yield

## Spot Rates and the Term Structure

-   The plot of the various spot rates and against time is known as the
    **Yield Curve** & the mathematical relationship between the two is
    known as the **Term Structure of Interest Rates**

-   Empirically, the yield curve has been shown to **take many shapes**:

    -   Upward, Downward, Flat etc

    -   Upward Yield Curves are the most common. However, for this
        course, we assume a **flat yield curve** unless stated otherwise
        (Spot rates are constant throughout)

-   If the yield curve is not flat, we do have a few options to
    determine the yield curve:

### Discretely Compounded Yield Curve

-   It is called Discrete because it only calculates points of the yield
    curve at discrete points (Typically 6-month intervals)

-   It uses the Prices of Bonds of various lengths to determine to
    reverse engineer the prevailing spot rates at the time

    -   The first period bond **must be a zero-coupon bond**. All other
        bonds can be regular annual/semi-annual coupon bonds

-   This method of calculating is also known as a **bootstrap method**:

    -   Calculate the first spot rate using the zero-coupon bond

    -   If the second bond has a coupon, **substitute in the spot rate
        calculated** **before** to discount it and then solve for the
        second spot rate

    -   Repeatedly and recursively do this until all spot rates have
        been found

-   If all Bonds were zero-coupon bonds, then this method would be a lot
    easier

### Continuously Compounded Yield Curve

-   We now consider **continuous interest** and **time points.** One key
    assumption we make is that the **force of interest is constant
    between two successive valuation dates**

-   It is based on the concept of **spot rates and forward rates.** By
    combining an initial spot rate and multiple forward rates, we are
    able to obtain spot rates for any period

-   We then form a **piecewise function** based on the time period to
    form the yield curve

**Linking Spot Rates and Force of Interest:**

$$e^{s_{t}*t} = e^{\int_{0}^{t}\delta_{t}}$$

$$s_{t} = \frac{1}{t}\int_{0}^{t}\delta_{t}$$

**Recursive nature (Splitting integration)**

$$e^{s_{t_{2}}*t_{2}} = e^{- \int_{0}^{t_{2}}\delta_{t_{2}}}$$

$$e^{s_{t_{2}}*t_{2}} = e^{- \int_{0}^{t_{1}}\delta_{t_{1}} + \int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}\delta_{t_{2} - t_{1}}}$$

$$s_{t_{2}} = \frac{1}{t_{2}}\left( \int_{0}^{t_{1}}\delta_{t_{1}} + \int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}\delta_{t_{2} - t_{1}} \right)$$

**In practice, we solve for the various** $\mathbf{\delta}$ **using bond
prices:**

-   The same key concept of splitting the force of interest intervals
    applies

# [Chapter 8: Bond Management]{.underline}

## Macaulay Duration (MacD)

-   It is the **Weighted Average** of the **time taken** **in YEARS**
    for cashflows to occur, weighted based on the **relative size of the
    PV of future cashflows.** It calculates **average amount of time
    needed to get breakeven on your investment**

-   Based on this, Cashflows that are **Larger** and **Occur Earlier**
    (Don't need to discount as much) will **influence the calculation
    more**. We can **use this intuition to check** our calculations to
    see if they make sense

### Deriving Macaulay Duration

$$\therefore MacD = \frac{1*PV + 2*PV_{2} + \ldots + n*PV_{n}}{PV_{1} + PV_{2} + \ldots PV_{N}} = \frac{\sum_{}^{}{t*v^{t}*CF_{t}}}{{\sum_{}^{}{v^{t}*CF}}_{t}} = - \frac{P^{'}(\delta)}{P(\delta)}$$

-   If all **cashflows are level**
    $\left( CF_{1} = \ldots CF_{n} \right)$, they can be **factorized
    out** from both the numerator and denominator, effectively
    cancelling out

-   Building on this, consider two sets of Cashflows:

    -   Set A: 1, 2, 3, 4...

    -   Set B: 100, 200, 300, 400...

-   We can factorise out 100 from Set B, which will cancel out and
    result in the same cashflows as Set A. Thus, MacD is **dependent not
    on the size but the pattern of cashflows**

### Other Time Frequencies

-   The typical duration formulas use full years (1,2,3...)

-   However, some questions (especially semi-annual bonds) have
    cashflows semi-annually

-   We can treat the semi-annual timings as a full year, then **convert
    it back to half years at the end!**

-   Alternatively, we can **treat them as** $\mathbf{0.5}$ **right from
    the get-go**

## Modified Duration

-   As its name suggests, ModD is simply a **modification of MacD**

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   The longer we must wait to get back our money, the larger the window
    for those cashflows to be affected by interest rates hence higher
    sensitivity to them

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Thus, we can modify MacD to directly approximate the **Sensitivity
    of the change in price of a Bond to changes in Interest Rates.**
    Thus, ModD measures the **percentage decrease in the value of the
    security per unit increase in interest rates (Price Risk)**

### Deriving Modified Duration

$$Price\ of\ a\ Security,\ P(i) = \sum_{}^{}{v^{t}*CF_{t}} = \sum_{}^{}{(1 + i)^{- t}*CF_{t}}$$

$$Changes\ in\ Price,\ P^{'}(i) = \sum_{}^{}{- t*(1 + i)^{- t - 1}*CF_{t}} = \sum_{}^{}{- t*v^{t + 1}*CF_{t}}$$

$$\therefore ModD = - \frac{P^{'}(i)}{P(i)} = - \frac{\sum_{}^{}{- t*v^{t + 1}*CF_{t}}}{\sum_{}^{}{v^{t}*CF_{t}}} = \frac{\sum_{}^{}{t*v^{t + 1}*CF_{t}}}{\sum_{}^{}{v^{t}*CF_{t}}} = v*\frac{\sum_{}^{}{t*v^{t}*CF_{t}}}{{\sum_{}^{}{v^{t}*CF}}_{t}} = \frac{MacD}{1 + i}$$

-   If interest compounds continuously, we can show a similar result for
    MacD as well

-   Note that if **no specification** was made, Duration refers to
    **Macaulay Duration**

### Portfolio Duration

-   Consider a portfolio of Bonds. We can **aggregate the cashflows**
    for the entire portfolio and then **calculate the Duration using the
    same method**

-   However, this can be time consuming. If we already know the
    **individual Durations** for each component, we can quickly
    calculate the Duration of the entire portfolio by using their
    **relative weights** (Similar to Modern Portfolio Theory)

-   Important: The weights MUST be **time-value adjusted**

$$MacD_{Portfolio} = w_{X}*MacD_{X} + w_{Y}*MacD_{Y} + w_{Z}*MacD_{Z} + \ldots$$

-   This same portfolio method **applies for Convexity** as well

## Different Comparison date

-   The base definition of Duration **assumes that it is calculated at
    time 0**

-   We can generalize the formula and calculate them on any date by
    understanding that **t represents the time till the cashflow occurs
    from the comparison date**

-   However, we can **link the durations across time** which may help us
    save time

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   If we were to move the comparison one period later, there are two
    different scenarios we must consider:

    -   **Calculate Duration BEFORE the payment**
        $\left( \mathbf{Mac}\mathbf{D}_{\mathbf{t}}^{\mathbf{'}} \right)$

        -   Under this scenario, the **cashflows remain the same** as
            compared to the original. The only thing that changed was
            time

        -   Thus, the average time taken for cashflows just moved
            forward a period:

        -   $MacD_{t}^{'} = MacD_{t - 1} - 1$

    -   **Calculate Duration AFTER the payment**
        $\left( \mathbf{Mac}\mathbf{D}_{\mathbf{t}} \right)$

        -   Since the payment has occurred, both the **cashflows and
            timing are different** as compared to the original

        -   Thus, we cannot form a relationship & must be manually
            recalculated

    -   For any given period**,**
        $\mathbf{Mac}\mathbf{D}_{\mathbf{t}}\mathbf{> Mac}\mathbf{D}_{\mathbf{t}}^{\mathbf{'}}$

        -   This is because $MacD_{t}$ removes the earliest cashflow,
            effectively removing the smallest value from the calculation

        -   Since MacD is an average, **removing the smallest value will
            force the average to increase in value as compared to**
            $\mathbf{Mac}\mathbf{D}_{\mathbf{t}}^{\mathbf{'}}$

## Using Durations for Estimations

-   Given the **only** current price of a Bond, we can **estimate** the
    new price of the bond for a specified change in interest rates using
    Durations

-   We consider a graph of the price of the Bond. Without knowing the
    equation for Price, we can approximate the new price **using the
    tangent at the current price**:

![Chart, line chart Description automatically
generated](media/image15.png){width="3.4534339457567804in"
height="2.4800240594925635in"}

Firstly, we consider the **first principles interpretation of
Tangent/Slope**,

$$P^{'}\left( i_{0} \right) = \frac{P^{*}\left( i_{n} \right) - P\left( i_{0} \right)}{i_{n} - i_{0}}$$

Next, we use the **ModD formula**,

$$ModD = - \frac{P^{'}\left( i_{0} \right)}{P\left( i_{0} \right)}$$

$$P^{'}\left( i_{0} \right) = - P\left( i_{0} \right)*ModD$$

Lastly, **we combine the two** and rearrange,

$$\frac{P^{*}\left( i_{n} \right) - P\left( i_{0} \right)}{i_{n} - i_{0}} = - P\left( i_{0} \right)*ModD$$

$P^{*}\left( i_{n} \right) - P\left( i_{0} \right) = \left( - P\left( i_{0} \right)*ModD \right)*\left( i_{n} - i_{0} \right)$

$$\mathbf{P}^{\mathbf{*}}\left( \mathbf{i}_{\mathbf{n}} \right)\mathbf{= \ P}\left( \mathbf{i}_{\mathbf{0}} \right)\mathbf{-}\mathbf{P}\left( \mathbf{i}_{\mathbf{0}} \right)\left( \mathbf{i}_{\mathbf{n}}\mathbf{-}\mathbf{i}_{\mathbf{0}} \right)\left( \mathbf{ModD} \right)$$

  **First Order Modified Approximation**                                                                              **First Order Macaulay Approximation**
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  $$P^{*}\left( i_{n} \right) = \ P\left( i_{0} \right) - P\left( i_{0} \right)\left( i_{n} - i_{0} \right)(ModD)$$   $$P\left( i_{n} \right) \approx P\left( i_{0} \right)\left( \frac{1 + i_{0}}{1 + i_{n}} \right)^{MacD}$$

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Proof for Macaulay variant is algebraically challenging and is not
    shown

-   Generally, Macaulay Approximation is **slightly more accurate** than
    the Modified one

### An alternative (Intuitive) way to think about Approximation

-   Premise → Macaulay and Modified Duration **represents time**

-   Looking at the formulas for the approximation, we notice that we
    have seen them before:

    -   **Macaulay** → $Interest^{Time}$ → **Compound Interest**

    -   **Modified** → $Interest*Time$ → **Simple Interest**

-   If interest rates were constant, we can simply use the original
    accumulation function. However, since interest rates changed, we
    **need to make a correction to the original**

-   Macaulay approximation is a **Compound Interest Correction,** while
    Modified Approximation is a **Simple Interest Correction**

-   Following the nature of each type of interest, Macaulay (Compound
    Interest) uses **Multiplication/Division** while **Modified**
    (Simple Interest) used **Addition/Subtraction**

## Convexity

-   Notice that we are **using a Line to approximate a Curve**. Thus,
    the first order approximations are good for **small changes** in
    price where the curve is relatively flat over that length

-   Since the curve is Convex, the line will always **under-approximate
    the price** of the bond. This under-approximation becomes greater
    the larger the change in interest rates as the curve begins to
    **bend more**

-   We can thus use the **Curvature to approximate this inherent error**
    (Convexity) and account for it to obtain a **more accurate
    approximation**

### [Additional Formulas]{.underline}

**Linking Duration and Convexity:**

$$ModC = v^{2}*(MacC + MacD)$$

**Second Order Modified Approximation:**

$$P\left( i_{n} \right) \approx P\left( i_{0} \right) - P\left( i_{0} \right)*\left( i_{n} - i_{0} \right)(ModD) + P\left( i_{0} \right)*\frac{\left( i_{n} - i_{0} \right)^{2}}{2}(ModC)$$

**Second Order Macaulay Approximation:**

$$P\left( i_{n} \right) \approx P\left( i_{0} \right)\left( \frac{1 + i_{0}}{1 + i_{n}} \right)^{MacD}*\left\lbrack 1 + \left( \frac{i - i_{0}}{1 + i_{0}} \right)^{2}\left( \frac{MacC - MacD^{2}}{2} \right) \right\rbrack$$

## Immunization

-   Companies often make payments (Liability Cashflows) and receive
    payments from their investments (Asset Cashflows)

-   The goal of any company is to ensure that they have **enough Asset
    Cashflows to cover their Liability Cashflows**. In other words, the
    **Present Value** of Asset Cashflows should be more than Liability
    Cashflows. We call the excess a **Surplus.**

    -   $Surplus = PV\left( CF_{Assets} \right) - PV\left( CF_{Liabilities} \right)$

-   However, this Surplus is prone to **interest rate risk**:

    -   When interest rates fall or rise, the present value of assets
        might fall, present value of liabilities might rise or both

    -   This causes the surplus to become negative which may put the
        company in a state of financial distress

-   The goal of any company is to thus find the **combination of
    securities such that no matter how interest rates change, the
    surplus will always increase or stay the same**. Essentially, they
    are **immunizing their surplus** from the effects of interest rates

### Redington Immunization (Duration Matching)

-   **Three assumptions needed**:

    -   Interest rates for all maturities are identical (Flat Yield
        Curve)

    -   A change in interest rates affects all maturities (Parallel
        shift)

    -   A change in interest rates do not affect cashflows (Fixed
        cashflows)

-   Under these three assumptions, a portfolio is **immunized from**
    **small changes** in interest rates if the following **three
    conditions** are met:

    -   $\mathbf{PV}\left( \mathbf{Assets} \right)\mathbf{= PV}\left( \mathbf{Liabilities} \right)\mathbf{\Longleftrightarrow}\mathbf{P}_{\mathbf{A}}\mathbf{=}\mathbf{P}_{\mathbf{L}}$

        -   They are the same because PV is equivalent to price

    -   $\mathbf{Duratio}\mathbf{n}_{\mathbf{Asset}}\mathbf{= Duratio}\mathbf{n}_{\mathbf{Liability}}\mathbf{\Longleftrightarrow}\mathbf{P}_{\mathbf{A}}^{\mathbf{'}}\mathbf{=}\mathbf{P}_{\mathbf{L}}^{\mathbf{'}}$

        -   Both Macaulay and Modified duration can be used here

        -   Since prices are the same, both their **denominators cancel
            out**, thus we only need to consider the **first
            derivative**

    -   $\mathbf{Convexit}\mathbf{y}_{\mathbf{Asset}}\mathbf{> Convexit}\mathbf{y}_{\mathbf{Liability}}\mathbf{\Longleftrightarrow}\mathbf{P}_{\mathbf{A}}^{\mathbf{''}}\mathbf{>}\mathbf{P}_{\mathbf{L}}^{\mathbf{''}}$

        -   Similarly, both Macaulay and Modified convexity applies.
            Since prices are the same, we only consider their **second
            derivative**

-   We can view this relationship **graphically:**

    -   Since prices are the same, both Asset and Liability price curves
        intersect at the current interest rate

    -   Since duration is the same, they have the same tangent at the
        intersection point

    -   Since Asset Convexity is greater, it curves higher than
        Liability

-   Given the same start point but asset curves more, the Asset will
    always **increase more and decrease less** than a similar change in
    Liabilities, ensuring surplus is protected

-   Thus, we can **use the first two conditions to solve** for the
    optimal portfolio, and then use the **third condition to check** if
    the solution is valid, if necessary

#### Another way to express the conditions:

-   We can also express the conditions in terms of Net Present Value
    (NPV)

-   **First condition** states that the present values must match,
    $\mathbf{NPV = 0}$

-   **Second condition** states that the first derivatives must match,
    $\mathbf{NP}\mathbf{V}^{\mathbf{'}}\mathbf{= 0}$

-   **Third condition** states that the second derivative of inflows
    must be higher, $\mathbf{NPV'' > 0}$

### Full Immunization

-   Similarly, it has the **same assumptions as Redington**:

    -   Flat Yield Curve, Parallel Shifts & Fixed Cashflows

-   It also has **similar conditions** as Redington, with only the last
    being different:

    -   $PV(Assets) = PV(Liabilities) \Longleftrightarrow P_{A} = P_{L}$

    -   $Duration_{Asset} = Duration_{Liability} \Longleftrightarrow P_{A}^{'} = P_{L}^{'}$

    -   **There must be one Asset Cashflow BEFORE and AFTER a Liability
        Cashflow**

        -   There can be more than one Liability, but each must be
            sandwiched between two Asset cashflows

        -   They do not have to be unique; there can be **infinitely
            many Liabilities between two Assets**

        -   Cashflows also include small ones such as Bond Coupons

-   The intuition behind it is **more qualitative:**

    -   Another way to think about Immunization is for the firm to is
        for cashflows to be worth the amount they expected, regardless
        of market conditions

    -   Imagine there was a rise in interest after the first asset
        cashflow. The value of liabilities would rise, but so would the
        Asset Cashflow that comes after that, mitigating the risk of
        interest rate changes. Vice-versa applies as well.

-   Comparing both types of Immunization:

    -   **Full immunization covers ALL** changes in interest rates,
        while **Redington covers only small interest rate changes**

    -   Full immunization is a **stricter version** of Redington
        Immunization -- Full is a **subset of Redington immunization. If
        Full Immunization conditions are met, it can also be used for a
        Redington problem**

### Immunization Shortcut

-   Find the duration of **EACH asset** and the **overall duration of
    the liabilities**. Using the **portfolio duration method**, equate
    both liabilities together:

    -   $w_{1}*MacD_{Asset\ 1} + w_{2}*MacD_{Asset\ 2} + \ldots = MacD_{Liabilities}$

    -   Solve for the weights of the portfolio, where
        $w_{2} = 1 - w_{1} + \ldots$

-   Find the **overall PV of the liabilities**. Multiply the calculated
    weights by the PV of the liabilities, to obtain the **PV of each of
    the assets** used. **Multiply by interest** accordingly to find the
    value of the assets when their cashflows occur

-   This process can be done as **all liabilities at once**, or for
    **individual liabilities**

    -   If we are given the Asset Cashflows, we can find its PV and
        calculate the weight using by comparing it to the PV of the
        liabilities (Reverse order)

### Alternative: Exact Cashflow Matching

-   Redington and Full Immunization require very hard assumptions that
    are unrealistic in the real world

-   This provides a simpler, more intuitive method by **matching the
    timing and amount** of Asset and Liability Cashflows

-   This method **STILL immunizes against ALL changes in interest
    rates**

-   Assume we have three bonds:

    -   $Bond_{1}$ matures in 1 year, with Face $F_{1}$, Coupon Rate
        $R_{1}$ and $YTM_{1}$

    -   $Bond_{n}$ matures in n years, with Face $F_{n}$, Coupon Rate
        $R_{n}$ and $YTM_{n}$

    -   $Bond_{N}$ matures in $N$ years, with Face $F_{N}$, Coupon Rate
        $R_{N}$ and $YTM_{N}$

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                    **Period 1**          **Period n**             **Period N**
  ----------------- --------------------- ------------------------ ------------------------
  $$Bond_{1}$$      $$F_{1}R_{1}$$        \-                       \-

  $$Bond_{n}$$      $$F_{n}R_{n}$$        $$F_{n} + F_{n}R_{n}$$   \-

  $$Bond_{N}$$      $$F_{N}R_{N}$$        $$F_{N}R_{N}$$           $$F_{N} + F_{N}R_{N}$$

                    $${Liability}_{1}$$   $${Liability}_{n}$$      $${Liability}_{N}$$
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Methodology:

We use the **Longest Bond to match the Longest Liability**:

$$F_{N} + F_{N}R_{N} = Liability_{N}\ $$

If the **liability is larger than the Face and Redemption** of a single
bond, then we need to **buy multiple bonds**. Let $x$ be the number of
**units to buy**, where $x$ can be a non-integer:

$$x_{N}\left( F_{N} + F_{N}R_{N} \right) = Liability_{N}\ $$

**Fill in the coupons** for previous period, then **repeat** for the
next longest liability:

$$x_{n}\left( F_{n} + F_{n}R_{n} \right) + x_{N}\left( F_{N}R_{N} \right) = Liability_{n}$$

$$\vdots$$

The total cost of exact matching is the number of **units multiplied by
the price** of each bond:

$$Total\ Cost = x_{1}*P_{1} + x_{n}*P_{n} + x_{N}*P_{N}$$

-   Note that each individual price is calculated using their respective
    $YTM$

-   If the coupons are all **zero-coupon bonds,** then the total cost of
    matching is simply the present value of the liabilities (no need to
    do the above steps)

Generally, there **are two kinds of problems** given:

-   **Face Value of the bonds are given**. In this case, you NEED to
    consider the UNITS of bonds of to buy since the Par Value is
    predetermined

-   **Face Value of the Bonds are NOT given**. In this case, you can
    directly solve for the "par" value of the bond needed

-   Both of these are the SAME. Both are calculating the true par value
    invested. Method 2 directly calculates this while method 1 has to
    consider the units of the bond because there is a fixed par value

# [Chapter 9: Determinants of Interest Rates]{.underline}

## How are Interest rates determined?

-   Interest rates can be viewed as the **cost of borrowing capital**.
    Like all things in economics, we can determine the equilibrium by
    considering the **supply and demand of capital**

-   There are two perspectives we must consider:

    -   **People with money (Lenders)**

        -   They can either choose to **spend it now, or lend the
            money** out & receive interest payments

        -   The **higher the interest, the more likely these people are
            to lend** the money. Thus, the money supply curve is
            **upward sloping**

    -   **People without money (Borrowers)**

        -   They can either choose to **refrain from spending, or borrow
            the money** & pay interest

        -   The **lower the interest, the more likely these people are
            to borrow money**. Thus, the money demand curve is
            **downward sloping**

-   By plotting out these two curves, the point at where they intersect
    is the equilibrium interest rate for the economy

-   This is an **over-simplified** explanation, as there are other
    factors that affect it as well:

    -   **Demand for capital** → Higher when economy is expanding or
        when new technology is discovered; people want more capital in
        these cases to take advantage of opportunities

    -   **Supply of capital →** Affected by Time Preference, Risk
        Appetite, Inflation & individual characteristics of securities

## [Central Banks and Interest Rates]{.underline}

### What is the central bank?

-   It functions as a **bank to other commercial banks** in the country

-   The central bank requires every commercial bank to deposit and
    maintain a specific amount with it, known as the **bank reserve
    requirement**

    -   This reserve is to **ensure that these banks have enough
        capital** so that they do not fall into financial distress

    -   The **amount required varies from bank to bank** as well as
        other situational factors

### What if banks fail to meet this requirement?

-   Banks may **fail to hit the requirements** for a variety of reasons,
    the most common being that they were too aggressive in lending money
    which results in more outflows than inflows during that period

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   They have two options to meet the shortfall in capital:

    -   Borrow from the **Central Bank** at the **discount rate**

    -   Borrow from other **Commercial Banks** at the **federal funds
        rate**

-   The central bank will always say yes to lending, which is why it is
    known as a **lender of last resort**. However, borrowing money
    directly from them **reflects poorly on the bank**, as it indicates
    difficulty in borrowing from other institutions due to **credibility
    issues**

-   This may result in more **scrutiny over the bank**, which is why
    they **prefer to borrow from another commercial bank** instead

### Impact on Interest rates

-   The part of the central bank that oversees this process is the
    **Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)**

-   They set the **target interest rates** that they would like **for
    the federal funds rate**, and then they will buy and **sell
    T-bills** in the secondary market to influence the federal funds
    rate

    -   This **affects the money demand and supply for T-bills**, which
        changes the discount rate, which makes borrowing from T-bills vs
        other banks **more or less desirable**

    -   It is in the **banks best interest to lend money out**, thus
        they will **adjust the fed funds rate to** **ensure that they
        are more competitive (LOWER) than the discount rate** to ensure
        that other banks will borrow from them rather than the CB

-   If the **discount rate increases**, **federal fund rate increases**,
    it becomes **more expensive for Banks to borrow money** hence **more
    costly for them to fall below the reserve requirement**

-   They will become **less aggressive** and **not lend out as much
    money**, reducing money supply and hence **increasing interest
    rates**

## Components of Interest Rate

-   We can decompose interest rates into several smaller components:

    -   **Real-Risk Free Rate** → Compensation for **deferred
        consumption**

    -   **Maturity Risk Premium** → Compensation for the risk of
        longer-term investments

    -   **Default Risk Premium** → Compensation for the risk of money
        not being paid

    -   **Inflation Risk Premium** → Compensation for loss of purchasing
        power due

    -   **Liquidity Risk Premium** → Compensation for added cost of
        converting to cash

-   This is consistent with what we learnt in FNCE101 -- The interest
    rates we observe is the combination of the Risk-Free Rate + Various
    Risk Premiums **(Reward for risk)**

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

-   Both ways of determining the various components are correct.
    However, for **simplicity**, we prefer to use the **Continuous
    Rates**

-   Some parts of this section are purely theoretical while others
    involve some calculation to actually determine the value of the
    component $r$

### Maturity Risk Premium

-   All else equal, longer-term investments will have a higher interest
    rate

-   There are several explanations:

    -   **Market Segmentation Theory** → Different investors have
        **clearly defined and different investment horizons**. This
        results in different supply & demand factors for different time
        horizons, resulting in different rates

    -   **Preferred Habitat Theory →** Builds off the above theory but
        says that the segments are **not written in stone**. These
        segments are just the preferred segment for investors. Given
        **better rates in another segment, these investors will move**

    -   **Liquidity Preference Theory** → Lenders typically **prefer to
        lend for a shorter time**; thus, they require higher rates to
        lend for longer times

    -   **Expectation Theory →** The longer the period of time, the more
        risk there is for interest rates to vary, which is why longer
        investments require a higher rate

        -   It also means that the current forward rates are an
            **unbiased estimator of the future spot rates**
            $\left( EG.\ f_{1}\ now\ is\ s_{1}\ one\ year\ from\ now \right)$

### Default Risk Premium

-   All else equal, investments with a higher chance of not paying have
    higher interest rates

-   There are two scenarios when it comes to defaulting:

    -   Defaults **with no recovery** (Pay some smaller amount instead)

    -   Defaults **with recovery** (Pay nothing)

-   Consider the **lenders perspective**. In either case, they want to
    **get the same amount**, no matter what the scenario. Thus, they
    charge an appropriate default risk premium:

    -   $Total\ \#*Loan\ Received = \#\ Non - Default*X + \#\ Default*Recovery$

    -   $X$ represents the **amount that needs to be RECEIVED**
        $\left( \mathbf{Loan*Interest} \right)$

    -   $X = Loan\ amount*e^{rt}$

    -   Solve for $\mathbf{r}$ **as our interest needed** →
        **Difference** between this and the original interest rate is
        the **default risk premium**

### Inflation Risk Premium

-   Inflation is the rise in the prices of goods and services over time

-   Inflation is approximated via tracking one of the following indices:

    -   **Consumer Price Index** (CPI) → Basket of typical consumer
        items

    -   **Producer Price Index** (PPI) → Basket of typical producer
        items

-   Inflation **decreasing the purchasing power** of money. Thus,
    Lenders of money want to be compensated via higher interest payments
    that scale with inflation. However, Borrowers are unwilling to pay
    this extra amount

-   We see this pan out in two different scenarios:

    -   **Lenders issue Loan with Inflation Protection for themselves**

        -   The amount of interest that the borrowers pay scales with
            inflation. To incentivise borrowers, they lower they base
            interest by the cost of protection (c)

        -   $R = r - c + i_{Actual}$

        -   In other words, Lenders are **willing to receive a lower
            amount of base interest to pass on the risk of inflation to
            the borrower**. In finance terms, since they experience
            **less risk, they require a lower reward** $(r - c)$

    -   **Lenders issue Loan without Inflation Protection for
        themselves**

        -   Not all borrowers are willing to bear the inflation risk
            themselves. They would **rather pay an extra but certain
            amount to the lender** to compensate them for bearing the
            inflation risk instead

        -   $R = r + i_{Expected} + i_{Unexpected}$

        -   In other words, Lenders are **willing to pay a higher base
            interest to retain the risk of inflation with the lender**.
            In finance terms, since the lender experiences **more risk,
            they have a higher reward**
            $\left( r + i_{e} + i_{ue} \right)$

    -   The problem is that the there **is no guarantee that the amount
        loaded is equivalent to the actual inflation rate experienced**.
        It could be better, or it could be worse

-   In finance/economics terms, we can view them in two different ways:

    -   **With** inflation protection → **Real Interest Rate**
        $\left( \mathbf{r - c} \right)$

    -   **Without** inflation protection → **Nominal Interest Rate**
        $\left( \mathbf{r +}\mathbf{i}_{\mathbf{e}}\mathbf{+}\mathbf{i}_{\mathbf{ue}} \right)$

    -   In a **perfect world**, where inflation can be predicted
        perfectly $\left( i_{e} + i_{ue} = i_{a} \right)$, then the
        following equation holds true (But the idea is there):

![Nominal Interest Rate -
Formula](media/image17.png){width="3.7416666666666667in"
height="2.057791994750656in"}

#### Other Points

-   Bonds in the US are usually **issued at nominal rates** rather than
    real rates

-   US tax is linked to the inflation rates

### Liquidity Risk Premium

-   All else equal, an investment that is **less-liquid** (Harder to
    convert to cash) have **higher interest rates**

-   Liquidity is defined as the speed and ease at which an asset can be
    converted to cash, without significant loss in value

-   The risk posed by an ill-liquid investment is that **if it has to be
    quickly converted to cash, it will lose a significant amount of its
    value**

-   Thus, in order to **compensate for this** loss of value, ill-liquid
    investments demand higher interest rates

# [Financial Calculator Tips]{.underline}

## Overview of using the BA II Plus 

-   It is a calculator with **pre-programmed financial formulas**. While
    this saves you the time of remembering and writing out formulas, you
    **must still understand how the formulas work to know which to use
    and what to input**

-   Its main usage should be for these **financial calculations**
    **only.** While it can perform more general calculations, it is
    recommended to stick to a scientific calculator for those

## Basic settings to toggle beforehand

-   By default, the calculator only shows values up to **2 decimal
    places.** Due to rounding errors in intermediate steps, this is not
    ideal for a math paper. We can change the number of decimal places
    displayed:

    -   [2^nd^ .]{.underline} → DEC → [9]{.underline}

    -   This sets the calculator to **FLOAT**, which means that it
        **displays up to 8** decimal places if available, otherwise up
        to the number of non-zero places

-   The calculator only allows for **one step of calculations at a time
    and evaluates them immediately.** It can be annoying to calculate a
    value using an equation this way, as one would have to use brackets
    (which can't be easily seen) to input successive steps. We can
    change the way the calculator evaluates a series of instructions:

    -   [2^nd^ .]{.underline} → CHN → [2^nd^ ENTER]{.underline}

    -   This sets the calculator to **Algebraic Operating System** which
        follows the BODMAS format of evaluating equations

## Basic calculator features

-   **Financial Functions** -- Since the calculator already has formulas
    built in, a large part of the process is **about assigning values**
    to these variables. There are two different ways:

    -   **Value to Variable** → Key in the [VALUES]{.underline} then
        press the [VARIABLE]{.underline}

        -   [CPT]{.underline} → [TARGET VARIABLE]{.underline}

    -   **Variable to Value** → Press the [VARIABLE]{.underline} then
        key in the [VALUES]{.underline} & press [ENTER]{.underline}

        -   [TARGET VARIABLE]{.underline} → [CPT]{.underline}

    -   Always ensure that the [TARGET VARIABLE]{.underline} is set to
        [0]{.underline}

    -   In all cases, we can confirm that the value has been properly
        assigned to the variable when we see a **full stop after the
        value**

    -   Once we are done with the function, we should use [2^ND^
        CE\|C]{.underline} or [2^nd^ FV]{.underline} to reset all other
        variables

-   **Storing Variables** -- It is not practical or memorize
    intermediate values. We can store them in one of the 9 memory slots
    and recall them at any time:

    -   [VALUE]{.underline} → [STO]{.underline} → [1-9]{.underline}
        (Stores a value in the chosen memory slot)

    -   [RCL]{.underline} → [1-9]{.underline} (Recalls a value from the
        chosen memory slot)

    -   [2^nd^ 0]{.underline} → [M1-9]{.underline} → [VALUE]{.underline}
        → [ENTER]{.underline} (View current stored data and manually
        edit

### Positive and Negative Signs

-   We use **Positive** signs for **Cash Inflows** and **Negative**
    signs for **Cash Outflows.** We can toggle between positive and
    negative using $+ | -$

-   We can determine whether they are Inflows and Outflows by choosing
    whose perspective we want to take - **Investor or the Fund Manager**

-   As an **Investor**, you **pay** an initial amount along with
    periodic payments. At the end, we **receive** our returns.
    [PV]{.underline} and [PMT]{.underline} are thus **negative**, while
    [FV]{.underline} is **positive.**

-   As the **Fund Manager**, you **receive** an initial amount along
    with periodic payments. At the end, you pay back the total returns.
    [PV]{.underline} and [PMT]{.underline} are thus **positive**, while
    [FV]{.underline} is **negative**

## Time Value of Money

-   The function can be used to determine the present value of any
    annuities and Bonds

[N]{.underline} → Number of periods

-   As the name suggests, this can represent any time period
    (Months/Years etc)

-   For perpetuities, we can input any number sufficiently large number
    (\~999)

[I/Y]{.underline} → Effective Interest per period **(Integer)**

[PV]{.underline} → Present Value

[PMT]{.underline} → Payment for Level **Annuity Immediate (Arrears)**

-   By **default, the option is payments at the end of the period**. We
    can change this by going to [2^nd^ PMT]{.underline} → [2^nd^
    ENTER]{.underline} which sets the mode to Beginning of the period
    instead

[FV]{.underline} → Future Value

## Amortization Schedule

-   This mode can only be accessed after filling in the relevant TVM
    variables for a bond

[2^nd^ PV]{.underline} → Amortization Mode

-   **P1** → Starting Period

-   **P2** → Ending Period

    -   Both should be the same value to find amortization in a specific
        period

-   **BAL** → Remaining Balance of the Loan after P2

-   **PRN** → Sum of the Principal paid from P1 to P2

-   **INT** → Sum of the interest paid from P1 to P2

## Cashflow Function

[CF]{.underline} → Cashflow Mode

-   **CF0** → Cashflow at time 0

    -   This is typically the **initial investment** amount & hence
        should be a **negative value**

-   **C01** → Cashflow at time 1

-   **F01** → Frequency of C01 (How many periods it repeats -- For
    perpetuities, put 999)

-   $\vdots$

[NPV]{.underline} → Net Present Value Mode

-   **I** → Interest Rate **(Integer, in %)**

[IRR]{.underline} → Internal Rate of Return

## Interest Rate Conversion (Nominal to Effective)

[2^nd^ 2]{.underline} → Enter Interest rate conversion mode

-   **EFF** → Effective Interest (**EAR** - Effective Annual Rate)

-   **NOM** → Nominal Interest Rate (**APR** -- Annual Percentage Rate)

    -   It is always assumed to be compounded 12 times a year unless
        stated otherwise

-   **C/Y** → Compounding Frequency over a year $(m)$
