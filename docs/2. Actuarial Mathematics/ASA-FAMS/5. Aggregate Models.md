# **Aggregate Models**

## **Overview**

The combination of the Frequency Models $(N)$ and the Severity Models $(X)$ discussed previously results in **Aggregate Model** $(S)$, which represents the **total losses** experienced by an insurance company.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    S &= X_1 + X_2 + ... + X_N
\end{aligned}
$$

The first type of aggregate model is known as the **Collective Risk Model**, which makes assumes the following assumptions:

1. **Losses are iid**: $X_1, X_2, ..., X_N$ are iid
2. **Frequency and Severity are independent**: $X$ and $N$ are independent

The second type is known as the **Individual Risk Model**, which makes similar assumptions:

1. **Losses are independent but not identical**: $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_N$ are independent but may have *different distributions*
2. **Frequency is a constant**: $N = n$
3. Typically used for **Group Policies** where there is a fixed number of poliycholders with varying levels of coverage
