# **Model Estimation**

This section assumes some basic knowledge on **Maximum Likelihood Estimation** (MLE), which can be found under another set of notes covering a [Review of Statistical Theory](../../3. Predictive Analytics/ASA-SRM/Review of Statistical Theory.md).

## **Motivation**

Rather than making an assumption about the distribution of frequency or losses or their parameters, we can **study the raw data directly** to gain a better understanding of it.

However, there are several key data-related concepts that must be covered.

## **Complete Data**

If given a full dataset where the value of each observation is known, then it is a complete dataset. Distribution parameters can be estimated normally through MLE.

For complete data only, the MOM shortcut can be used for the following distributions:

* Gamma & Exponential
* Normal & Lognormal
* Poisson
* Binomial & Bernoulli
* Negative Binomial & Geometric

Notice that all of the (a, b, 0) distributions are listed. Thus, their **zero-modified counterparts** can also be found using the shortcut:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E \left(X^M \right)
    &= \frac{1 - p^{m}_{0}}{1 - p_{0}} \cdot E(X) \\
    &= \frac{1 - p^{m}_{0}}{1 - p_{0}} \cdot \bar{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

## **Incomplete Data**

In practice, insurers often work with **incomplete data**, where they **do not have the exact values** of observations or only have a **partial dataset**.

### **Truncated**

The first type of incomplete data is known as **Truncated Data**. It means that the dataset **does not include** observations past a specified threshold.

<center>

| Left Truncation | Right Truncation |
| :-: | :-: |
| Truncated from below | Truncated from above |
| No values below $d$ | No values above $u$ |

</center>

The most common case would be **Left Truncated** data, which occurs when the policy has a **Deductible**. This is because when the loss amount does not need meet the deductible, policyholders **would not bother to report** it. Thus, the insurer **only receives loss amounts that exceed the deductible**.

!!! Warning

    The notation for the threshold is $d$ to denote deductible. HOWEVER, the notation $u$ here DOES NOT represent policy limits!

In terms of MLE, this means that the **ENTIRE distribution is conditioned** on having values above $d$ or below $u$. Thus, the likelihood functions should be constructed using conditional PMFs/PDFs of **every observation**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    P_{\theta} (X = x \mid X \gt d) &= \frac{P_{\theta}(X = x)}{P(X \gt d)}
    \\ \therefore L^{LT}(\theta) &= \prod P_{\theta} (X = x_i \mid X \gt d) \\
    \\
    P_{\theta} (X = x \mid X \lt u) &= \frac{P_{\theta}(X = x)}{P(X \lt u)}
    \\ \therefore L^{RT}(\theta) &= \prod P_{\theta} (X = x_i \mid X \lt u)
\end{aligned}
$$

<!--
Most likely, **claims data will be provided** and will be used for the MLE of the loss distribution. Thus, in order to convert claim payments into losses, remember to **add back the deductibles**.
-->

### **Censored**

The second type of incomplete data is known as **Censored Data**. It means that **exact values of certain observations** are not known.

<center>

| Left Censored | Right Censored |
| :-: | :-: |
| Censored from below | Censored from above |
| Values **at most** $d$; record as $d$ | Values **at least** $u$; record as $u$ |

</center>

![Censored Data](Assets/8.%20Model%20Estimation.md/Censored%20Data.png){.center}

The most common case would be **Right Censored** data, which occurs when the policy has a **Policy Limit**. This is because when the policyholder submits a claim, they will only **submit up to the amount that the limit covers**, even when the actual loss exceeds that amount. Thus, insurers will **only receive loss amounts at the limit**.

!!! Warning

    Similar to the warning from before, the notation for the threshold is $u$ to denote policy limit. HOWEVER, the notation $d$ here DOES NOT represent deductibles!

    $u$ and $d$ are still used in order to be consistent and ease understanding.

In terms of MLE, this means that the **likelihoods of censored observations are incorrect**. Instead of the PMF/PDF, they should be represented by the **probability that they are larger/smaller than the threshold**.

Thus, for censored observations at the threshold, the updated likelihoods must be used:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    L^{LC}(\theta) &= \prod P_{\theta} (X = x_{\text{Not Censored}}) \cdot \prod P(X_{\text{Censored}} \le d) \\
    L^{RC}(\theta) &= \prod P_{\theta} (X = x_{\text{Not Censored}}) \cdot \prod P(X_{\text{Censored}} \ge u)
\end{aligned}
$$

Naturally, truncation and censoring can occur at the same time. The likelihood for the censored observation in this case is thus:

$$
    P_{\theta}(X \gt d + u \mid x \gt d) = \frac{P_{\theta}(X \gt d + u)}{P_{\theta}(X \gt d)}
$$

### **Grouped**

The last type of incomplete data is known as **Grouped Data**. Similar to censoring, the exact values of *ALL* observations are not known. Instead, they are presented as the number of observations in a **distinct interval**.

!!! Tip

    Ranges are concisely expressed using the **bracket notation** - () denotes that the bound is exlcusive while [] denotes that it is inclusive. For instance, (15, 20] denoted that the amount is **strictly larger** than 15 but **less than or equal** to 20; $15 \lt 5 \le 20$.

In terms of MLE, the likelihood of an observation within this range is simply the **difference of the CDFs** at the end and beginning of the interval:

$$
    P_{\theta}(a \le X \le b) = P_{\theta}(X \le b) - P_{\theta}(X \le a)
$$

For a discrete distribution, this can be simplified to the sum of PMFs at each value:

$$
    P_{\theta}(a \le X \le b) = P_{\theta}(X = a) + \dots + P_{\theta}(X = b)
$$
