# **Loss Reserving**

## **Overview**

General Insurance claims may be filed **long after** the loss event occurs, thus they must set up a **Loss Reserve** to ensure that they have enough capital to pay out these claims well into the future.

Generally speaking, this process involves **estimating how the loss will develop over time**, until it reaches some final amount. The loss reserve is thus *difference* between the final amount that they expect to pay out and what has already been paid out:

$$
    \text{Loss Reserve} = \text{Final Loss} - \text{Paid Loss}
$$

## **Loss Terminology**

This subsection will properly introduce the proper terminology regarding losses

There are three basic building blocks of a reported claim:

* **Incurred Losses**: **Reported** loss amount
* **Paid Losses**: Loss amounts that have been **reported and paid out**
* **Case Reserve**: Loss amounts that have been **reported but not yet paid out**

$$
    \text{Incurred Loss} = \text{Paid Loss} + \text{Case Reserve}
$$

As mentioned previously, claims can be reported any time after an accident has occured. Thus, there will always be claims for losses that have already been incurred in the past but have not been reported to the insurer, appropriately named as **Incurred But Not Reported** (IBNR) losses.

This is the **main quantity** that the insurer must set up a reserve for, known as the **IBNR Reserve**. The loss reserve is thus the combination of the two aforementioned reserves:

$$
    \text{Loss Reserve} = \text{Case Reserve} + \text{IBNR Reserve}
$$

The **estimated total loss amount** that the insurer will pay to *finally* the close the claim is known as the **Ultimate Loss**. Thus, the first equation can be rewritten more formally:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{Loss Reserve} &= \text{Ultimate Loss} - \text{Paid Loss} \\
    \\
    \text{Loss Reserve} &= \text{Ultimate Loss} - \text{Paid Loss} \\
    \text{Case Reserve} + \text{IBNR Reserve} &= \text{Ultimate Loss} - \text{Paid Loss} \\
    \text{IBNR Reserve} &= \text{Ultimate Loss} - \text{Paid Loss} - \text{Case Reserve} \\
    \text{IBNR Reserve} &= \text{Ultimate Loss} - (\text{Paid Loss} + \text{Case Reserve}) \\
    \text{IBNR Reserve} &= \text{Ultimate Loss} - \text{Incurred Loss}
\end{aligned}
$$

## **Expected Loss Ratio Method**

The **simplest method** for estimating ultimate losses is known as the **Expected Loss Ratio Method**.

**Loss Ratios** (LR) are the **ratio of losses to premiums**, which is a measure of the percentage of premiums that have been used to pay losses. Ideally, the insurer would like to have a **loss ratio lesser than 100%**.

$$
    \text{LR} = \frac{\text{Loss}}{\text{Premium}}
$$

The **Expected Loss Ratio** (ELR) is the **final loss ratio**; the ratio of the ultimate loss to the total premiums collected. Thus, since total premiums are known, ultimate losses can be estimated by estimating the ELR:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{ELR} &= \frac{\text{Ultimate Loss}}{\text{Total Premium}} \\
    \\
    \therefore \text{Ultimate Loss} &= \text{Earned Premium} \cdot \text{ELR}
\end{aligned}
$$

The above is calculated per **Block of Business**. It refers to a **group of similar policies** under the **same line of business** over the **same policy period**.

For most questions, the data provided is typically **aggregated by accident year**, thus **different accident years represent different blocks of business**.

The total reserve is thus the sum of the reserve for all blocks of business (AY):

$$
    \text{Total Reserve} = \sum \text{Reserve}_\text{AY}
$$

## **Chain Ladder Method**

Another method of estimating ultimate losses is known as the **Chain Ladder** (CL) Method.

This methods works by finding **patterns in historical loss development** and assumes that future losses will **continue to develop in a similar manner**.

In order to efficiently find patterns in historical losses, they are recorded in a convenient format known as a **Development Table**:

* **Each Cell** represents the loss that occurred in that year
* **Each Row** shows losses that occurred in the **same Accident Year** (AY)
* **Each Column** shows losses that occurred in the **same Development Year** (DY)
* **Each Diagonal** shows losses that occurred in the **same Calendar Year** (CY)

!!! Note

    The AY that the diagonal originates from is the CY for that calendar year. This can be seen by the colouring of the cells in the table below.

DYs are also known as the **age of the claim** as they indicate how long after the AY when the claims are paid - DY3 represents that the claim was paid 3 years after the AY.

The next step is to find the **Cumulative Losses** per AY. This is done by changing the values of each cell to the **sum of all previous cells in the same row**.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{Cumulative Loss} &= \text{Sum of Losses in the same AY} \\
    \text{Cumulative Cell}_{AY, DY} &= \sum_{DY} \text{Incremental Cell}_{AY, DY}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Note

    Some questions may directly provide the cumulative loss in the table rather than incremental losses, saving you the time of having to sum everything up.

The number of columns indicates how long the insurer expects the losses to develop for. If the last column is DY6, then all claims must be **settled and closed by DY6**. Thus, the **cumulative loss at DY6 is the ultimate loss**.

!!! Warning

    Some questions will require us to construct our own table. Thus, it is important to fully **understand the intuition** behind each of the components.

    The fundamental assumption behind the method is that losses take the **same duration to mature** to their ultimate values.

    Note that this DOES NOT mean that losses all reach thier ultimate values on the same year. Losses originating from different AYs will always reach ultimate on a different year; **same duration NOT same date**.

    Thus, the DYs can be thought of as the **age of the losses**. Losses from later AYs are **"younger" and hence need more time to mature**.

The goal is now to find the h**istorical patterns** in the losses and then use those patterns to fill up the blank half of the development table.

The historical patterns are known as **Loss Development Factors** (LDF), which is the **ratio of the current DY's cumulative loss to the previous DY's cumulative loss**:

$$
    \text{LDF}_{AY, DY} = \frac{\text{Cumulative Cell}_{AY, DY}}{\text{Cumulative Cell}_{AY, DY-1}}
$$

<!-- Obtained from Coaching Actuaries -->
![LDF Development Table](Assets/6.%20Loss%20Reserving.md/LDF%20Development%20Table.png){.center}

The next step would be to **develop each years using the development factors**, until it reaches the ultimate loss:

$$
    \text{Cumulative Cells}_{AY, DY+1} = \text{Cumulative Cells}_{AY, DY} \cdot \text{LDF}_{AY, DY}
$$

However, the problem is that for all years other than the final year, there are **multiple LDFs** for each DY. There are a few solutions to this: Simple Average, Recent Average or Weighted Average, usually **specified by the question**.

Assuming that the simple average is used, we will arrive at the following LDFs and thus the corresponding **final development table**:

![Final Development Table](Assets/6.%20Loss%20Reserving.md/Final%20Development%20Table.png){.center}

Using this table, the reserve for each AY can be calculated:

1. **Ultimate Loss**: Cell in the *last* column
2. **Paid Loss**: Cell in the *last originally* filled column (Highlighted in yellow)

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{Reserve}_{AY}
    &= \text{Ultimate Loss} - \text{Paid Loss} \\
    &= \text{Cumulative Cell}_{AY, DY Final} - \text{Cumulative Cell}_{AY, DY Original} \\
    \\
    \therefore \text{Total Reserve} &= \sum_{\text{AY}} \text{Reserve}_{AY}
\end{aligned}
$$

<!-- Obtained from Coaching Actuaries -->
![Reserve Development Table](Assets/6.%20Loss%20Reserving.md/Reserve%20Development%20Table.png){.center}

Technically speaking, it is a waste of time find an estimate for all the blank cells in the table, since we are only interested in the final column.

Thus, instead of slowly multiplying the LDFs each year, we can instead find an **Age to Ultimate** LDF, which as its name suggests, when multiplied provides the ultimate loss for that AY.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{LDF}_{AY, Ultimate} &= \prod^{\text{DY Final}}_{DY Original} \text{LDF}_{AY, DY} \\
    \\
    \text{Ultimate Loss} &= \text{Paid Loss} \cdot \text{LDF}_{AY, Ultimate}
\end{aligned}
$$

## **Bornhautter Ferguson Method**

The **Bornhautter Ferguson** (BF) method balances both the above methods to produce an estimate.

Using the CL method, the following result is obtained:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{Ultimate Loss} &= \text{Paid Loss} \cdot \text{LDF}_{\text{Ultimate}} \\
    \frac{\text{Paid Loss}}{\text{Ultimate Loss}} &= \frac{1}{\text{LDF}_{\text{Ultimate}}} \\
    \text{Proportion of Paid Losses} &= \frac{1}{\text{LDF}_{\text{Ultimate}}} \\
    \text{Proportion of Unpaid Losses} &= 1 - \frac{1}{\text{LDF}_{\text{Ultimate}}} \\
    \\
    \therefore \text{Loss Reserve} &= \text{Ultimate Loss} \cdot \left(1 - \frac{1}{\text{LDF}_{\text{Ultimate}}} \right)
\end{aligned}
$$

The BF method **combines the ELR and CL method together** by calculating the Ultimate Loss in the above expression using the ELR method, resulting in the **BF Reserves**:

$$
    \text{Loss Reserve}_{BF}
    = \text{Ultimate Loss}_{ELR} \cdot \left(1 - \frac{1}{\text{LDF}_{\text{CL, Ultimate}}} \right)
$$

!!! Warning

    One **common misunderstanding** is that the BF Ultimate Loss is the ELR Ultimate Loss, because it was what is used in the equation.

    Notice that unlike the previous two methods, the BF method **directly estimates the reserves**, not the Ultimate Losses.

    Thus, to obtain the ultimate losses, simply add the **estimated reserves to the paid losses**:

    $$
        \text{Ultimate Loss}_{\text{BF}} = \text{Loss Reserve}_{\text{BF}} + \text{Paid Loss}
    $$

Another way of expressing the above is that the BF method uses the **weighted average of the two methods**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{Loss Reserve}_{BF} &= w \cdot \text{Loss Reserve}_{CL} + (1-w) \cdot \text{Loss Reserve}_{ELR} \\
    w &= \frac{1}{\text{LDF}_{\text{CL, Ultimate}}}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Warning

    The above applies for ONLY THE OVERALL RESERVE, not the Case or IBNR reserves.

!!! Note

    As the claims approach maturity, more the LDF factors decrease, causing the **weights to the CL method** to increase.

    This is intuitive, as **more data is available** for those claims, thus **more weight is given to the method that uses actual claims experience** (CL).

As with both the other methods, the **BF reserves is calculated per AY**, thus the total reserve is the sum of the reserves for each AY:

$$
    \text{Total Reserve}_{BF} = \sum \text{Reserve}_\text{BF, AY}
$$
