# **Severity Models**

## **Severity Distributions**

The **size of the loss** is usually known as **Loss Severity** and is typically modelled with a continuous distribution. 

Let $X$ be the random variable denoting the size of the loss.

This section will cover *most* of the relevant severity distributions, but similarly note that there is **no need to memorize** anything as they are all provided in the formula sheet.

## **Policy Modifications**

**Policy Modifications** are the parts of an insurance policy that defines **how much the insurer is required to pay** for each loss incurred by the policyholder.

Before continuing, there are **two key notations** ($\land, {}_{+}$)that will be used throughout this subsection:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \min (a, b)
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        a,& a \lt b \\
        b,& a \ge b
    \end{cases} \\
    &= a \land b \\
    \\
    \max (a-b, 0)
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        0,& a \lt b \\
        a-b,& a \ge b
    \end{cases} \\
    &= (a-b)_{+} \\
    &= \text{Non-negative part; floored at 0}
\end{aligned}
$$

The two are related through the following expression:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    (a-b)_{+} &= a - (a \land b) \\
    \\
    \text{If } a &\gt b \text{,} \\
    (a-b)_{+} &= a-b \\
    a - (a \land b) &= a-b \\
    \therefore (a-b)_{+} &= a - (a \land b) \\
    \\
    \text{If } a &\lt b \text{,} \\
    (a-b)_{+} &= 0 \\
    a - (a \land b) &= a-a = 0 \\
    \therefore (a-b)_{+} &= a - (a \land b) \\
\end{aligned}
$$

There are three key **random variables** regarding claims and losses:

1. $X$ is the **Ground Up Loss** variable, representing the **total loss incurred by the policyholder**
2. $Y^L$ is the **Payment per Loss** variable, representing the **amount paid by the insurer**
3. $Y^P$ is the **Payment per Payment** variable, representing the amount paid by the insurer **given that there is a positive payment**

To properly understand the difference between the three, consider an example of a policy with a **deductible of 800**, but in two different situations:

<center>

| $X$ or Loss | $Y^L$ | $Y^P$ |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 2000 | 1200 | 1200 |
| 600 | 0 | **NOT Observed** |

</center>

There are two main takeaways:

* If $Y^L > 0$, then $Y^P = Y^L$
* If $Y^L = 0$, then $Y^P$ is NOT Observed
* $\therefore Y^P = Y^L \mid Y^L > 0$

!!! Warning

    Do NOT mistakenly think that $Y^P$ being unobserved is equivalent to $Y^P = 0$. They are completely DIFFERENT.

$Y^L$ can be thought of as a **two point mixture distribution** of $Y^P$ and a **not-so-random-variable that always takes 0**. Thus, it can also be thought of as a conditional distribution dependent on whether $Y^L \gt 0$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    F_{Y^L} (t)
    &= F_{Y_L | Y^L > 0} (t) \cdot P(Y^L > 0) + F_{Y_L | Y^L = 0} (t) \cdot P(Y^L = 0) \\
    &= F_{Y^P} (t) \cdot P(Y^L > 0) + F_{0} (t) \cdot P(Y^L = 0) \\
\end{aligned}
$$

Let $\pi = P(Y^L > 0)$, which becomes the weight of the mixture:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    F_{Y^L} (t) &= F_{Y_P} (t) \cdot \pi + F_{0}(t) \cdot (1-\pi)  \\
    1 - F_{Y^L} (t) &= [1 - F_{Y_P} (t)] \cdot \pi + [1-F_{0}(t)] \cdot (1-\pi) \\
    S_{Y^L} (t) &= S_{Y_P} (t) \cdot \pi \\
    \\
    E \left(Y^L \right) &= E \left(Y^P \right) \cdot \pi + E(0) \cdot (1-\pi) \\
    E \left(Y^L \right) &= E \left(Y^L \right) \cdot \pi
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, the values for $Y^L$ and $Y^P$ can be **easily converted to one another** by using the weight of the mixture (probability of a positive payment).

Additionally, since $Y^P$ is essentially $Y^L$ being conditional on itself, we can easily obtain its conditional distribution:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    f_{Y_P} (y)
    &= f_{Y^L \mid Y^L \gt 0} (y) \\
    &= \frac{f_{Y^L} (y)}{P(Y^L \gt 0)}
\end{aligned}
$$

### **Deductibles**

The first type of coverage modification is known as a **Deductible** $d$. It is the amount that the policyholder is responsible for paying beore the insurer pays a claim:

* If the loss amount **does not exceed** the deductible, then the insurer will **pay out nothing**
* If it does **exceed the deductible**, then the insurer will **pay out the excess**

For each loss $X$, the **policyholder** is responsible for paying losses up to $d$. It is denoted by $X \land d$, which is known as the **Limited Loss Variable**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    X \land d
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        X,& X \le d\\
        d,& X \gt d
    \end{cases}
\end{aligned}
$$

The **insurer** will then cover the excess amount, represented by the **Payment Per Loss** variable:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    Y^L = (X-d)_{+}
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        0,& X \le d\\
        X - d,& X \gt d
    \end{cases}
\end{aligned}
$$

Using the previously established relationship, a **shortcut** for the expectation can be found:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    (X-d)_{+} &= X - (X \land d) \\
    Y^L &= X - (X \land d) \\
    \therefore E \left(Y^L \right) &= E(X) - E(X \land d)
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Tip

    This is especially useful because for every severity distribution, $E(X) and $$E(X \land d)$ are **provided in the formula sheet**.

The above formula **only holds for the first raw moment**. Thus, if higher moments are required, then it must be calculated from **first principles**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E \left(Y^L \right)
    &= E \left[(X-d)_{+} \right] \\
    &= \int^{d}_{0} 0 \cdot f(x) + \int^{\infty}_{d} (x-d) \cdot f(x) \\
    &= \int^{\infty}_{d} (x-d) \cdot f(x) \\
    \\
    \therefore E \left[ \left(Y^L \right)^k \right] &= \int^{\infty}_{d} (x-d)^k \cdot f(x)
\end{aligned}
$$

In practice, policyholders would **not report losses below the deductible** as there is no point doing so. Thus, the insurers payment is better represented by the **Payment Per Payment** variable, also known as the **Excess Loss Variable**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    Y^P
    &= Y^L \mid Y^L \gt 0 \\
    &=  Y^L \mid X \gt d \\
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        \text{Undefined},& X \le d\\
        X - d,& X \gt d
    \end{cases} \\
    \\
    f_{Y_P} (y)
    &= \frac{f_{Y^L} (y)}{P(Y^L \gt 0)} \\
    &= \frac{f_{Y^L} (y)}{P(X \gt d)} \\
    &= \frac{f_{Y^L} (y)}{1 - F_{X}(d)}
\end{aligned}
$$


Thus, $Y^P$ has the following conditional



$$

$$


Intuitively, the expected payment per loss is **smaller than the expected loss** since there will not be any payments for losses smaller than or equal to the deductible:

\begin{aligned}
    E \left(Y^L \right) & \le E(X)
\end{aligned}
