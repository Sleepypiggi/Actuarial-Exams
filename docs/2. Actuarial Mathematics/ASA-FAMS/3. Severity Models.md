# **Severity Models**

## **Severity Distributions**

The **size of the loss** is usually known as **Loss Severity** and is typically modelled with a continuous distribution. 

Let $X$ be the random variable denoting the size of the loss.

This section will cover *most* of the relevant severity distributions, but similarly note that there is **no need to memorize** anything as they are all provided in the formula sheet.

## Policy Features

As mentioned previously, most insurance policies have some **coverage modifications** such that the claim payments are often **not equal to the size of the losses**.

Thus, let $Y$ be the random variable denoting the **claim amount** that will be paid by the insurer.

### **Deductibles**

The first type of coverage modification is known as a **Deductible**, denoted by $d$.

If the loss amount **does not exceed** the deductible, then the insurance will **pay out nothing**. However, if it does **exceed the deductible**, then the insurance will **pay out the excess above the deductible**.

Note that if the loss is **equal to the deductible**, then still **nothing is paid out** because there is no excess above the deductible.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    Y
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        0,& X \le d\\
        X - d,& X \gt d
    \end{cases}
\end{aligned}
$$

Notice that $Y$ is a mixed random variable:

1. For $X \le d$, it is **discrete variable** with support $\set{0}$
2. For $X \gt d$, it is a **continuous variable** with support $(x-d, \infty]$


### Limits

The second type of coverage modification is known as Limit, denoted by $u$.

### Coinsurance

### Inflation


### **Scaling & Transformation**

Method of creating new distributions from existing ones?
