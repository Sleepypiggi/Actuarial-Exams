# **Ratemaking**

## **Fundamental Equation**

**Ratemaking** is the process of determining **how much premium** to charge a policyholder. It is important to set rates such that there is **enough premium** collected to cover losses and expenses while still generating a profit for the insurer.

This is illustrated through the **Fundamental Insurance Equation**:

$$
    \text{Premium} = \text{Loss} + \text{Expense} + \text{Profit}
$$

The remaining subsections will go in-depth into each component of this equation.

## **Losses**

Losses are the main component of premiums. However, before they can be used, they must be **Aggregated**, **Developed** & **Trended**.

### **Loss Aggregation**

Losses can be aggregated according to the following categories:

1. **Calendar Year** (CY): Losses that only occur from **1 Jan to 31 Dec** of that year
2. **Accident Year** (AY): ALL losses from an **accident that occurred** in a specified 12 month period  
3. **Policy Year** (PY): ALL losses from a **policy that was issued** in a specified 12 month period

Unless otherwise stated, the **specified 12 month period follows the calendar year**. In otherwise, Policy Year 2015 refers to a policy that was issued from 1 Jan 2015 to 31 Dec 2015.

Since AY and PY consider ALL losses, they usually have a **cut off date** known as the **Valuation Date**, such that they **only consider the losses occuring at or before that date**.

The valuation date is usually referred to as the losses "As at" or "As of". They refer to the **cumulative losses** at that time.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{CY Paid} &= \text{Sum of all paid losses in CY} \\
    \text{CY Incurred} &= \text{CY Paid} + \text{Change in Case Reserves} \\
    \\
    \text{AY/PY Paid} &= \text{Sum of all paid losses at Valuation Date} \\
    \text{AY/PY Incurred} &= \text{AY/PY Paid} + \text{Case Reserves at Valuation Date}
\end{aligned}
$$

### **Loss Development**

Using the above aggregations, the losses can be developed to their ultimate values using the **chain ladder method** described in the reserving section.

<!-- Nothing more to be said? -->

### **Loss Trending**

Lastly, **losses must be trended** to account for factors that drive losses such as inflation, increased medical costs or technological advances.

!!! Warning

    Loss Trending and Development are **often confused with one another** as both involve adjusting the loss amount. Some people also believe that only one of them should be applied to a loss because applying both would **double count certain factors**, known as the **Overlap Fallacy**.

    However, note that they are extremely different concepts:

    **Loss Development** is about bringing an **immature loss to its ultimate amount**, as losses take time to be discovered and reported to the insurer.

    **Loss Trending** is about bringing the **ultimate loss today to what it would be at a future time**, as losses are also subject to **external factors such as inflation**.

Similar to development, trending involves using historical data to find trends and then project them into the future:

$$
    \text{Trended Ultimate Loss} = \text{Ultimate Loss} \cdot (1 + \text{Trend Factor})^\text{Trend Period}
$$

However, finding trend factors is out of scope for this exam. Thus, the main focus will be on **determining the trend period**.

Formally speaking, it is the difference between the midpoint of the **Experience Period** and the midpoint of the **Forecast Period**:

* **Experience Period**: Period in which losses can occur for policies with **old rates**
* **Forecast Period**: Period in which losses can occur for policies with **new rates**

![Trend Period](Assets/7.%20Ratemaking.md/Trend%20Period.png){.center}

For the **experience period**, the calculation changes depending on what was used to aggregate the loss data:

* **AY Aggregation**: Experience period is the AY
* **PY Aggregation**: Experience period is the PY PLUS the policy term

To better understand PY, consider an example - Assuming policies are **written uniformly throughout the year**, it means that there will be policies **written on the first and last day of the PY**.

* **Written on First Day**: Expires on the last day of PY
* **Written on Last Day**: Expires on last day of PY plus policy term

Based on the definition, we are looking for the maximum possible timespan where policies with the old rates can exist:

* The **earliest time** it can exist is when a policy is **written on the first day**
* The **latest time** it exist is when a policy **written on the last day expires**
* Assuming that the rates are only in effect for that PY

<!-- Obtained from Coaching Actuaries -->
![PY Period](Assets/7.%20Ratemaking.md/PY%20Period.png){.center}

The **exact same concepts apply to the forecast period**. The only difference is that the rates may be in effect for a longer or shorter time, thus the "last day" might not be the last day of the PY, but rather some arbitrary date.

$$
    \text{Trend Period} = \text{Forecast Period Midpoint} - \text{Experience Period Midpoint}
$$

### **Other Trending Methods**

Rather than using *just one* trending factor, insurers might sometimes use multiple trending factors to obtain a trended ultimate and then take a **weighted average** of all of them instead.

Similarly, they could also use **regression** to project the trended ultimate. Based on the regression slope $(m)$, the trended ultimate can be calculated:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    L^T &= L^U + mt \\
    \\
    \ln L^T &= \ln L^U + mt \\
    \ln \frac{L^T}{L^U} &= mt \\
    \frac{L^T}{L^U} &= e^{mt} \\
    L^T &= L^U \cdot e^{mt}
\end{aligned}
$$

## **Expenses**

There are two main types of expenses - **Loss Adjustment Expenses** (LAE) and **Other Expenses**.

LAE are expenses that are **incurred during the claim settlement process** and are typically included as **part of the incurred losses**.

They can be further split into two categories:

* **Allocated LAE** (ALAE): Expenses **associated with** a specific claim (EG. Lawyer's Fee)
* **Unallocated LAE** (ULAE): Expenses that are **NOT associated** with a specific claim (EG. Salaries)

As its name suggests, other expenses is a catch all for non-LAE expenses. They are generally split into two categories:

* **Variable Expenses** (VE): Expenses that vary with premium (EG. Commissions)
* **Fixed Expenses** (FE): Expenses that do NOT vary with premium (EG. Salaries)

$$
    \text{Expenses} = \text{VE} \cdot P + \text{FE}
$$

## **Profit**

Profits can be included in ratemaking either implicitly or explicitly.

By using **more conservative estimates** than usual, **actual experience should be better** than expected, which **implicitly** results in profit for the insurer.

Alternatively, they can **explicitly include a margin for the target profit** (T) in the ratemaking process, as seen in the fundamental insurance equation.

$$
    \text{Profit} = T \cdot P
$$

Based on this, we can find the **target loss ratio** such that the premiums are sufficient to cover both variable expenses and meet the profitability target, known as the **Permissible Loss Ratio** (PLR):

$$
\begin{aligned}
    P &= L + FE + VE \cdot P + T \cdot P \\
    P - VE \cdot P - T \cdot P &= L + FE \\
    P \cdot (1 - VE - T) &= L + FE \\
    1 - VE - T &= \frac{L + FE}{P} \\
    \\
    \therefore \text{PLR} &= 1 - VE - T
\end{aligned}
$$

## **Premiums**

After determining premiums using the above information, the **premiums can still be adjusted based on historical data**, similar to losses.

Thus, we need to aggregate premiums as well to better study them. However, since premiums cannot be linked to specific accidents, they can only be aggregated by CY or PY.

Premiums can also be categorized in three ways, based on their **accounting** definitions:

* **Written Premium** (WP): Total premium collected
* **Earned Premium** (EP): Portion of premium used to provide insurance
* **Unearned Premium** (UP): Portion of premium that has yet to be used to provide insurance

The above are all calculated at a specific point in time, which is the end of year for CY and the valuation date for PY.

$$
    \text{WP} = \text{EP} + \text{UP}
$$

### **Extension of Exposures**

Generally speaking, premiums are the product of the following two quantities:

1. **Exposure Base**:
2. **Rate per unit of Exposure**:

$$
    \text{Premium} = \text{Exposure Base} \cdot \text{Rate per Exposure}
$$

However, not all exposures are continuous (EG. Gender - Male, Female). In this case, discrete **Risk Classifications** are used instead.

These premiums are then **calculated relatively** - in other words, it assumes some **base classification** will be charged a certain premium and then **adjusts it accordingly if the risk classification is different**.

!!! Note

    The concept is similar to dummy variable regression.

Formally speaking, the base risk classification is known as the **Base Cell**, which is usually the **most common risk class**. The **premium for this risk class** is known as the **Base Rate**.

In order to adjust the premiums, **each risk class has its own rate**, collectively known as the **Rate Differentials** for the rating variable. Naturally, the rates for the base cell are 1 to reflect that *it is* the base.

$$
    \text{Premium} = \text{Base Rate} \cdot \text{Rate Relativities}
$$

The **Extension of Exposures** brings old premiums to the current level by simply recalculating them at the current rates instead:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{Old Premium} &= 300 \cdot 1.2 \cdot 0.8 = 288 \\
    \text{On Level Premium} &= 330 \cdot 1.30 \cdot 0.70 = 300.30
\end{aligned}
$$

### **Parallelogram Method**

One issue with the above method is that it requires highly granular data. In practice, most insurers only have access to **aggregated data**.

Instead of being provided with the exact rates, yearly **rate changes** are provided:

<!-- Obtained from Coaching Actuaries -->
![Rate Changes](Assets/7.%20Ratemaking.md/Rate%20Changes.png){.center}

This information can be reorganized into a **series of parallelograms**:

* **Horizontal Axis**: Time
* **Vertical Axis**: Percentage of Premiums earned
* **Diagonal Axis**: Boundary seperating policies with different rates

Individual parallelograms represent blocks of policies with the same rates while Squares represent calendar years.

WITHIN each calendar year, calculate the **geometric areas** of the different blocks of policies, assuming that the length of the square is 1.

<!-- Obtained from Coaching Actuaries -->
![Geometry Review](Assets/7.%20Ratemaking.md/Geometry%20Review.png){.center}

Since the area of the square is 1, the individual components of each square will add up to 1. Thus, they can be used as **weights** to calculate the **weighted average** of the **cumulative rate changes** at the start and end of the CY:

<!-- Obtained from Coaching Actuaries -->
![Geometry Weighted Average](Assets/7.%20Ratemaking.md/Geometry%20Weighted%20Average.png){.center}

Lastly, calculate the on-level as the ratio of the current cumulative rate changes to the average rate changes for that CY:

$$
    \text{On Level Factor} = \frac{\text{Current Cumulative Rate Change}}{\text{Average Cumulative Rate Change}}
$$

<!-- Obtained from Coaching Actuaries -->
![On Level Factors](Assets/7.%20Ratemaking.md/On%20Level%20Factors.png){.center}

These factors can be used to bring any premium to their on-level amount, similar to the age to ultimate LDF.

$$
    \text{On Level Premium} = \text{Premium}_{\text{CY}} \cdot \text{On Level Factor}_{\text{CY}}
$$

### **Rate Changes**

Ratemaking is a prospective process to determine how much premiums should be charged based on our estimates of the future.

The objective is to find out how much the current premiums should be adjusted to reach the adequate level, known as a **Rate Change**.

The premiums currently being charged is known as the **Current Premium** $(P^c)$ while the Premiums that should be charged are known as the **Indicative Premium** $(P^I)$.

The indicative premium can be determined using the fundamental insurance equation:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    P^I &= L + FE + VE \cdot P^I + T \cdot P \\
    P^I - VE \cdot P^I - T \cdot P^I &= L + FE \\
    P^I \cdot (1 - VE - T) &= L + FE \\
    P^I &= \frac{L + FE}{1 - VE - T} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

The rate change can determined in one of the two following methods:

The **Loss Ratio Method** divides both sides by the Current Premium $(P^c)$, turning the loss on the RHS into a **Loss Ratio**, which earns the method its name.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    P^I &= \frac{L + FE}{1 - VE - T} \\
    \frac{P^I}{P^c} &= \frac{\frac{L}{P^c} + \frac{FE}{P^c}}{1 - VE - T} \\
    \frac{P^I}{P^c} - 1 &= \frac{LR + \frac{FE}{P^c}}{1 - VE - T} - 1 \\
    \\
    \therefore \text{Rate Change} &= \frac{LR + \frac{FE}{P^c}}{1 - VE - T} - 1
\end{aligned}
$$

Similarly, the **Pure Premium Method** divides both sides by the **Number of Exposures** $(n^e)$, turning the loss on the RHS into a Pure Premium, which earns the method its name.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    P^I &= \frac{L + FE}{1 - VE - T} \\
    \frac{P^I}{n^e} &= \frac{\frac{L}{n^e} + \frac{FE}{n^e}}{1 - VE - T} \\
    \\
    \therefore \text{Rate Change} &= \frac{\frac{L}{n^e} + \frac{FE}{P^c}}{1 - VE - T}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Tip

    If multiple years of data is given, then take the **average** of the Losses/Current Premium before plugging them back into the equation.
