# **Premiums**

Unlike other products, the cost of a Life Assurance or Annuity are not known when it is issued, as it is **impossible to precisely predict** when an individual will die or how long they will live for.

Premiums are the amount that the insurance company charges for a Life Assurance or Annuity. They aim to charge a sufficiently high premium such that they **expect** to (*at least*) **break even** on the sale of the policy.

Premiums are always **paid in advance**, but the frequency of payment depends on the type of premium:

<center>

| Single Premium | Limited Premium | Regular Premium |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Single Lump Sum | Recurring for a fixed period | Recurring as long as the contract is valid |
| Use dollar amount | Modelled using TA Annuities | Modelled using WL Annuities |

</center>

> If premiums are paid in arrears instead, the policyholder may refuse to pay premiums on the flawed grounds that since they did not die in the period, they did not utilize the coverage and hence should not pay.

There are two types of premiums that can be calculated:

* **Net Premiums** - *Excluding* expenses; based on benefits only
* **Gross Premiums** - *Including* expenses; based on BOTH benefits and expenses

> Other cashflows such as a fixed profit margin can also be considered.

## **Equivalence Principle Approach**

To determine the breakeven point of the insurer, the expected amount of loss must first be defined.

Thus, let $L_x$ be the random variable denoting the loss of the policy:

* If $L_x$ is positive, then the policy is losing money
* If $L_x$ is negative, then the policy is making money
* The intepretation is reversed since $L$ represents an **outflow** rather than an inflow!

$$
\begin{aligned}
    L_x
    &= \text{PV Outflow} - \text{PV Inflows}
\end{aligned}
$$

The goal is to solve for the premiums such that there is **no expected loss**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E(L_x) &= 0 \\
    \text{EPV Outflow} &= \text{EPV Inflow}
\end{aligned}
$$

This is known as the **Equivalence Principle** approach as it sets the EPVs to be equal.

The loss variable for Net and Gross can be differentiated using superscripts:

* **Net Premium**: $L^{B}_{x}$, where $B$ represents the **B**enefits only
* **Gross Premium**: $L^{B+E}_{x}$, where $B+E$ represents **B**enefits and **E**xpenses

For the simple case of net premiums,

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E \left(L^{B}_{x} \right) &= 0 \\
    \text{EPV Benefits} &= \text{EPV Premiums} \\
    B \cdot A_x &= P \cdot \ddot{a}_x \\
    P &= B \cdot \frac{A_x}{\ddot{a}_x}
\end{aligned}
$$

## **Portfolio Percentile Approach**

If there are a large number of policies within the insurer's portfolio, then the insurer can consider the **breakeven on a portfolio of policies** rather than a single policy.

Let $Y$ be the random variable denoting the **aggregate loss** on a portfolio of $n$ policies.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    Y & \sim iid \\
    E(Y) &= n \cdot E(L) \\
    Var(Y) &= n \cdot Var(L) \\
\end{aligned}
$$

If the insurer has a large portfolio of policies ($n$ is sufficiently large), then through **Central Limit Theorem**,

$$
    Y \sim N(E(Y), Var(LP))
$$

The premium is then set such the **probability of profit** is set a pre-determined level close to 1:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    P(Y < 0) &= \alpha \\
    P\left(\frac{Y - E(Y)}{\sqrt{Var (Y)}} \le \frac{0 - E(Y)}{\sqrt{Var (Y)}}\right) &= \alpha \\
    P\left(Z \le \frac{- E(Y)}{\sqrt{Var (Y)}}\right) &= \alpha \\
    P\left(Z \le \frac{- n \cdot E(L)}{n \cdot \sqrt{Var (L)}}\right) &= \alpha \\
    P\left(Z \le \frac{- E(L)}{\sqrt{Var (L)}}\right) &= \alpha
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, only the expectation and variance of an **individual policy** is required:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    L_x
    &= B \cdot \text{WL} - P \cdot \text{WL}_{Due} \\
    &= B \cdot \text{WL} - P \cdot \frac{1- \text{WL}}{d} \\
    &= B \cdot \text{WL} - P \left(\frac{1}{d}-\frac{\text{WL}}{d} \right) \\
    &= B \cdot \text{WL} - P \left[\left(\frac{1}{d}\right) + P\left(\frac{\text{WL}}{d}\right) \right] \\
    &= \text{WL} \left(B + \frac{P}{d} \right) - \frac{P}{d} \\
    \\
    \therefore E(L_x)
    &= E \left[\text{WL} \left(B + \frac{P}{d} \right) - \frac{P}{d} \right] \\
    &= A_x \left(B + \frac{P}{d} \right) - \frac{P}{d} \\
    \\
    \therefore Var(L_x)
    &= Var\left[\text{WL} \left(B + \frac{P}{d} \right) - \frac{P}{d} \right] \\
    &= Var \left[\text{WL} \left(B + \frac{P}{d} \right) \right] \\
    &= \left(B + \frac{P}{d} \right)^2 \cdot Var(\text{WL}) \\
    &= \left(B + \frac{P}{d} \right)^2 \cdot \left[{}^{2}A_x - (A_x)^2 \right]
\end{aligned}
$$

The premiums determined this way will **always be larger** than the premiums determined through the equivalence principle:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    P_{\text{Portfolio Percentile}} &\ge P_{\text{Equivalence Principle}} \\
    \\
    \text{As n} &\to \infty \\
    P_{\text{Portfolio Percentile}} &\to P_{\text{Equivalence Principle}}
\end{aligned}
$$

<!-- Why? -->

## **Net Premiums**

There are two types of expenses in a typical insurance policy:

<center>

| **Overhead Expenses** | **Direct Expenses** |
| :-: | :-: |
| For all policies | For a specific policy |
| Spread out among all policies | Borne only by that policy |
| EG. Office Rental | EG. Sales Commission |

</center>

They are typically determined in one of three ways:

* **Percentage of premiums** - EG. Sales Commission
* **Percentage of benefits** - EG. Underwriting Expenses
* **Fixed amount** - EG. Overhead Expenses

Certain expenses are only charged at certain time points:

1. **Policy Inception** - Single payment at known time; directly use amount
2. **During Policy** - Unknown number of recurring payments; model using **Annuity Functions**
3. **Policy Termination** - Single payment at unknown time; model using **Assurance Functions**

Expenses on policy inception are typically known as **Acquisition Expenses** while expenses during the policy are known as **Renewal Expenses**.

> Initial expenses are usually higher as it is costly to set up a policy.

Expenses may also increase over time by a factor of $(1+r)$ each year, known as **Expense Inflation**. If this occurs, then the expenses are modelled using **Geometric Annuities and Assurances** instead.

### **Expense Annuities**

Since renewal expenses only occur from **year 1 onwards**, they are calculated using annuity *immediates* rather than due, despite being paid in advance.

<!-- Self Made Diagram -->

> Recall that beginning of Y1 is the same as end of Y0.

This can be worked around by **combining** the initial expense with the renewal expenses, creating a payment at the start of Y0 such that an annuity due can be used.

Consider the following example:

* Initial Expense - $0.5G + 0.02B + 10$
* Renewal Expenses - $0.1G + 0.01B + 4$

Express the initial expense as a function of the renewal expenses:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    0.5G + 0.02B + 10
    &= (0.1G + 0.01B + 4) + (0.4G + 0.01B + 6) \\
    &= \text{Renewal Expense} + (0.4G + 0.01B + 6)
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, the EPV of expenses can be expressed using a life annuity due:

$$
    \text{EPV Expense} = (0.1G + 0.01B + 4)\ddot{a}_x + (0.4G + 0.01B + 6)
$$

> This does not hold true if Expense Inflation occurs as the second payment of the geometric annuity would be higher than the first payment of the renewal expense.

### **New Business Strain**

If only expenses are considered for premium calculations (ignoring benefits), then the resulting premium is known as the **Expense Premium**.

It can also be calculated as the **difference** between Gross and Net Premiums:

$$
    \text{Expense Premium} = \text{Gross Premium} - \text{Net Premium}
$$

The expense premium is **always smaller than the initial expenses**. The insurer **does not collect enough premiums** to set-up the policy, thus has to fork out their own capital to cover the initial cost. This results in an initial financial loss known as the **New Business Strain**.

However, the expense premium is always higher than the renewal expenses, reflecting that the insurer **recovers the loss over time**.
