# **Premiums**

## **Overview**

Unlike other products, the cost of a Life Assurance or Annuity are not known when it is issued, as it is **impossible to precisely predict** when an individual will die or how long they will live for.

Premiums are the amount that the insurance company charges for a Life Assurance or Annuity. They aim to charge a sufficiently high premium such that they expect to at least **break even** on the sale of the policy on an **EPV basis**.

Premiums are always **paid in advance**, but the frequency of payment depends on the type of premium:

<center>

| Single Premium | Limited Premium | Regular Premium |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Single Lump Sum | Recurring for a fixed period | Recurring as long as the contract is valid |
| Use dollar amount | Modelled using TA Annuities | Modelled using WL Annuities |

</center>

!!! Info

    If premiums are paid in arrears instead, the policyholder may refuse to pay premiums on the flawed grounds that since they did not die in the period, they did not utilize the coverage and hence should not pay.

There are two types of premiums that can be calculated:

* **Net Premiums, $P$** - *Excluding* expenses; based on benefits only
* **Gross Premiums, $G$** - *Including* expenses; based on BOTH benefits, expenses and other cashflows

The key thing to notice is that the components of net premiums are fixed while gross premiums differ from insurer to insurer. Thus, this section will **only show formulas for net premiums**.

## **Equivalence Principle Approach**

To determine the breakeven point of the insurer, the expected amount of loss must first be defined.

Thus, let ${}_{t}L$ be the random variable denoting the loss of the policy:

* If ${}_{t}L$ is positive, then the policy is losing money
* If ${}_{t}L$ is negative, then the policy is making money
* The **intepretation is reversed** since $L$ represents an **outflow** rather than an inflow!

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t}L
    &= \text{PV Outflow} - \text{PV Inflows} \\
    &= B \cdot v^{K_{x+t} + 1} - P \cdot \ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{K_{x+t} + 1}}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Note

    Remember that there is a **difference between the PV and EPV**!

    PVs contain the random variable and are denoted in general notation while EPVs should NOT contain the random variable and are denoted in actuarial notation.

The goal is to solve for the premiums such that there is **no expected loss at time 0**. This is known as the **Equivalence Principle** approach as it sets the EPVs to be equal:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E \left({}_{0}L \right) &= 0 \\
    \text{EPV Benefits} &= \text{EPV Premiums} \\
    B \cdot A_x &= P \cdot \ddot{a}_x \\
    P &= B \cdot \frac{A_x}{\ddot{a}_x}
\end{aligned}
$$

If the time of the loss is not specified, then it can be assumed to be time 0.

!!! Warning

    Note that the above assumes that benefits and premiums are **payable discretely**. If they were payable more frequently, then the corresponding formula should be used.

    Regardless, note that $P$ in the above contract represents the **ANNUAL PREMIUM**. To obtain the premium payable per period, it should be divided by the number of periods:

    $$
        \text{Premium Per Period} = \frac{P}{m}
    $$

## **Portfolio Percentile Approach**

An alternative approach would be to use the **distribution of the loss** and set the premiums in such a way that the **probability of profit** is fixed at some acceptable level.

Using the formula for net premiums, we can express the loss random variable in a different way:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t}L
    &= B \cdot v^{K_{x+t} + 1} - P \cdot \ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{K_{x+t} + 1}} \\
    &= B \cdot v^{K_{x+t} + 1} - P \cdot \frac{1- v^{K_{x+t} + 1}}{d} \\
    &= B \cdot v^{K_{x+t} + 1} + \frac{- P + P v^{K_{x+t} + 1}}{d} \\
    &= v^{K_{x+t} + 1} \left(B + \frac{P}{d} \right) - \frac{P}{d} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, the mean and variance can be determined:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E({}_{t}L)
    &= E \left[v^{K_{x+t} + 1} \left(B + \frac{P}{d} \right) - \frac{P}{d} \right] \\
    &= \left(B + \frac{P}{d} \right) E(v^{K_{x+t} + 1}) - E \left(\frac{P}{d} \right) \\
    &= \left(B + \frac{P}{d} \right)A_{x+t}  - \frac{P}{d} \\
    \\
    \text{Var}({}_{t}L)
    &= \text{Var}\left[v^{K_{x+t} + 1} \left(B + \frac{P}{d} \right) - \frac{P}{d} \right] \\
    &= \text{Var} \left[v^{K_{x+t} + 1} \left(B + \frac{P}{d} \right) \right] \\
    &= \left(B + \frac{P}{d} \right)^2 \cdot \text{Var} \left(v^{K_{x+t} + 1} \right) \\
    &= \left(B + \frac{P}{d} \right)^2 \cdot \left[{}^{2}A_{x+t} - (A_{x+t})^2 \right]
\end{aligned}
$$

The distribution of a single policy cannot be determined. However, if there were a **large number of policies**, then the *aggregate loss* of those policies would be **approximately normal distributed** via the central limit theorem.

Since policies are homogenous, they are **independent and identically distributed**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    S
    &= {}_{t}L_1 + {}_{t}L_2 + ... + {}_{t}L_n \\
    &= n \cdot {}_{t}L \\
    \\
    E(S)
    &= E(n \cdot {}_{t}L) \\
    &= n \cdot E({}_{t}L) \\
    \\
    \text{Var}(S)
    &= \text{Var} (n \cdot {}_{t}L) \\
    &= n^2 \cdot \text{Var} ({}_{t}L) \\
    \\
    \therefore S &\sim N(E(S), \text{Var}(S))
\end{aligned}
$$

The premium is then set such the **probability of profit** is set a pre-determined level close to 1:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    P(S < 0) &= \alpha \\
    P\left(\frac{S - E(S)}{\sqrt{Var (S)}} \le \frac{0 - E(S)}{\sqrt{Var (S)}}\right) &= \alpha \\
    P\left(Z \le \frac{- E(S)}{\sqrt{Var (S)}}\right) &= \alpha \\
    P\left(Z \le \frac{- n \cdot E({}_{t}L)}{\sqrt{n^2 \cdot Var ({}_{t}L)}}\right) &= \alpha \\
    P\left(Z \le \frac{- n \cdot E({}_{t}L)}{n \cdot \sqrt{Var ({}_{t}L)}}\right) &= \alpha  \\
    P\left(Z \le \frac{- E({}_{t}L)}{\sqrt{Var ({}_{t}L)}}\right) &= \alpha
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Note

    If the target value is NOT 0, then the $n$ in the numerator and denominator will NOT cancel out!

By plugging in the values determined earlier and solving for P, the appropriate premiums can be determined.

## **Gross Premiums**

What makes gross premiums so much trickier than net premiums is that there are many **different types of expenses**, where every question can ask for a unique combination of them.

Expenses can be differentiated in terms of when they are charged:

<center>

| **Acquisition Expenses** | **Renewal Expenses** | **Termination Expense** |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| At policy **inception** | During policy **lifetime** | At policy **termination** |
| Single payment at **time 0** | Recurring payments from **time 1** onwards | Single payment at unknown time |
| Denoted by $e_0$ | Denoted by $e_t$ | Denoted by $E$ |
| Directly use amount | Corresponding **Annuity** Functions | Corresponding **Assurance** Function |
| EG. Commissions expenses | EG. Administrative Expenses | EG. Claims expenses |

</center>

!!! Warning

    Renewal Expenses is also sometimes known as **Maintenance Expenses**.

    Although they are usually charged from policy year 2 onwards, they **can be charged in the first year as well**. Always read the question properly.

Renewal Expenses can also **inflate** over time, where they increase by a factpr of $(1+r)$ each year. In this case, they are modelled using a **geometrically increasing annuity** instead.

!!! Info

    Acquisition expenses are usually higher than renewal ones as agent commissions are mostly front-loaded in the first year to give agents cash faster, incentivizing them to sell more.

They can also be differentiated in terms of how much they charge:

<center>

| **Overhead Expenses** | **Direct Expenses** |
| :-: | :-: |
| Shared among all policies | Borne by a specific policy |
| **Fixed** amount | **Percentage** of policy premium |
| Spread out among all policies | Borne only by that policy |
| EG. Office Rental | EG. Sales Commission or Underwriting Expenses |

</center>

!!! Tip
    
    Generally speaking, per policy expenses are charged every year while commissions are charged whenever premiums are paid. This is relevant for questions that do not specify the frequency of expenses. 

Note that gross premiums can also include other cashflows, such as a pre-determined **profit margin**. Since these are rare and highly dependent on the situation, they will not be covered in this section.

### **Expense Calculations**

Consider the expenses of the policy:

<!-- Self Made -->
![Expense Cashflows](Assets/6.%20Premiums.md/Expense%20Cashflows.png){.center}

The PV of the expenses can be easily calculated by using an annuity immediate, which can be converted into an annuity due for convenience:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{EPV Expenses}
    &= e_0 + e_t \cdot a_x \\
    &= e_0 + e_t \cdot (\ddot{a}_{x} - 1)
\end{aligned}
$$

However, note that the simplification **does NOT hold true if there is expense inflation** -  the level annuity immediate CANNOT simply be replaced with the geometric annuity.

This is because the expenses only start to inflate from the third payment onwards:

### **Expense Premiums**

The difference between the gross and net premiums represent the premium needed to **cover just the expenses**. It is known as the **Expense Loading**, as it represents the amoount **loaded onto the net premiums for expenses**.

Since it is still a premium, the **equivalance principle** still applies to it:

$$
    \text{EPV Expense Loading} = \text{EPV Expenses}
$$

Intuitively, it is the **difference between the gross and net premium**:

$$
    G^E = G - P
$$

It will be used more in the next section on reserving.
