# **Premiums**

Unlike other products, the cost of a Life Assurance or Annuity are not known when it is issued, as it is **impossible to precisely predict** when an individual will die or how long they will live for.

Premiums are the amount that the insurance company charges for a Life Assurance or Annuity. They aim to charge a sufficiently high premium such that they expect to at least **break even** on the sale of the policy on an **EPV basis**.

Premiums are always **paid in advance**, but the frequency of payment depends on the type of premium:

<center>

| Single Premium | Limited Premium | Regular Premium |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Single Lump Sum | Recurring for a fixed period | Recurring as long as the contract is valid |
| Use dollar amount | Modelled using TA Annuities | Modelled using WL Annuities |

</center>

> If premiums are paid in arrears instead, the policyholder may refuse to pay premiums on the flawed grounds that since they did not die in the period, they did not utilize the coverage and hence should not pay.

There are two types of premiums that can be calculated:

* **Net Premiums, $P$** - *Excluding* expenses; based on benefits only
* **Gross Premiums, $G$** - *Including* expenses; based on BOTH benefits, expenses and other cashflows

The key thing to notice is that the components of net premiums are fixed while gross premiums differ from insurer to insurer. Thus, this section will **only show formulas for net premiums**.

## **Equivalence Principle Approach**

To determine the breakeven point of the insurer, the expected amount of loss must first be defined.

Thus, let $L_x$ be the random variable denoting the loss of the policy:

* If $L_x$ is positive, then the policy is losing money
* If $L_x$ is negative, then the policy is making money
* The intepretation is reversed since $L$ represents an **outflow** rather than an inflow!

$$
\begin{aligned}
    L_x
    &= \text{PV Outflow} - \text{PV Inflows}
\end{aligned}
$$

The goal is to solve for the premiums such that there is **no expected loss**. This is known as the **Equivalence Principle** approach as it sets the EPVs to be equal:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E(L_x) &= 0 \\
    \text{EPV Outflow} &= \text{EPV Inflow}
\end{aligned}
$$

The loss variable for Net and Gross can be differentiated using superscripts:

* **Net Premium**: $L^{B}_{x}$, where $B$ represents the **B**enefits only
* **Gross Premium**: $L^{B+E}_{x}$, where $B+E$ represents **B**enefits and **E**xpenses

For Net Premiums only,

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E \left(L^{B}_{x} \right) &= 0 \\
    \text{EPV Benefits} &= \text{EPV Premiums} \\
    B \cdot A_x &= P \cdot \ddot{a}_x \\
    P &= B \cdot \frac{A_x}{\ddot{a}_x}
\end{aligned}
$$

## **Portfolio Percentile Approach**

If there are a large number of policies within the insurer's portfolio, then the insurer can consider the **breakeven on a portfolio of policies** rather than a single policy.

Let $Y$ be the random variable denoting the **aggregate loss** on a portfolio of $n$ iid policies:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    Y & \sim iid \\
    E(Y) &= n \cdot E(L) \\
    Var(Y) &= n \cdot Var(L) \\
\end{aligned}
$$

If the insurer has a large portfolio of policies ($n$ is sufficiently large), then through **Central Limit Theorem**,

$$
    Y \sim N(E(Y), Var(Y))
$$

The premium is then set such the **probability of profit** is set a pre-determined level close to 1:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    P(Y < 0) &= \alpha \\
    P\left(\frac{Y - E(Y)}{\sqrt{Var (Y)}} \le \frac{0 - E(Y)}{\sqrt{Var (Y)}}\right) &= \alpha \\
    P\left(Z \le \frac{- E(Y)}{\sqrt{Var (Y)}}\right) &= \alpha \\
    P\left(Z \le \frac{- n \cdot E(L)}{n \cdot \sqrt{Var (L)}}\right) &= \alpha \\
    P\left(Z \le \frac{- E(L)}{\sqrt{Var (L)}}\right) &= \alpha
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, only the expectation and variance of an **individual policy** is required. For net premiums only,

$$
\begin{aligned}
    L_x
    &= B \cdot \text{WL} - P \cdot \text{WL}_{Due} \\
    &= B \cdot \text{WL} - P \cdot \frac{1- \text{WL}}{d} \\
    &= B \cdot \text{WL} - P \left(\frac{1}{d}-\frac{\text{WL}}{d} \right) \\
    &= B \cdot \text{WL} - P \left[\left(\frac{1}{d}\right) + P\left(\frac{\text{WL}}{d}\right) \right] \\
    &= \text{WL} \left(B + \frac{P}{d} \right) - \frac{P}{d} \\
    \\
    \therefore E(L_x)
    &= E \left[\text{WL} \left(B + \frac{P}{d} \right) - \frac{P}{d} \right] \\
    &= A_x \left(B + \frac{P}{d} \right) - \frac{P}{d} \\
    \\
    \therefore Var(L_x)
    &= Var\left[\text{WL} \left(B + \frac{P}{d} \right) - \frac{P}{d} \right] \\
    &= Var \left[\text{WL} \left(B + \frac{P}{d} \right) \right] \\
    &= \left(B + \frac{P}{d} \right)^2 \cdot Var(\text{WL}) \\
    &= \left(B + \frac{P}{d} \right)^2 \cdot \left[{}^{2}A_x - (A_x)^2 \right]
\end{aligned}
$$

The premiums determined this way will **always be larger** than the premiums determined through the equivalence principle:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    P_{\text{Portfolio Percentile}} &\ge P_{\text{Equivalence Principle}} \\
    \\
    \text{As n} &\to \infty \\
    P_{\text{Portfolio Percentile}} &\to P_{\text{Equivalence Principle}}
\end{aligned}
$$

<!-- Why? -->

## **Gross Premiums**

What makes gross premiums so much trickier than net premiums is that there are many **different types of expenses**, where every question can ask for a unique combination of them.

Expenses can be differentiated in terms of when they are charged:

<center>

| **Acquisition Expenses** | **Renewal Expenses** | **Termination Expense** |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| At policy **inception** | During policy **lifetime** | At policy **termination** |
| Single payment at **time 0** | Recurring payments from **time 1** onwards | Single payment at unknown time |
| No transformation needed | Corresponding **Annuity** Functions | Corresponding **Assurance** Function |
| EG. Commissions expenses | EG. Administrative Expenses | EG. Claims expenses |

</center>

Renewal Expenses can also **inflate** over time, where they increase by a factpr of $(1+r)$ each year. In this case, they are modelled using a **geometrically increasing annuity** instead.

> **IMPORTANT**: Acquisition expenses are usually higher than renewal ones as agent commissions are mostly front-loaded in the first year to give agents cash faster, incentivizing them to sell more.

They can also be differentiated in terms of how much they charge:

<center>

| **Overhead Expenses** | **Direct Expenses** |
| :-: | :-: |
| Shared among all policies | Borne by a specific policy |
| Fixed amount | Percentage of policy premium or benefit |
| Spread out among all policies | Borne only by that policy |
| EG. Office Rental | EG. Sales Commission or Underwriting Expenses |

</center>

Note that gross premiums can also include other cashflows, such as a pre-determined **profit margin**. Since these are rare and highly dependent on the situation, they will not be covered in this section.

### **Expense Calculations**

Consider a policy that only has **acquisition and renewal expenses**, denoted by A and R respectively:

<!-- Self Made -->
![Expense Cashflows](Assets/6.%20Premiums.md/Expense%20Cashflows.png){.center}

The PV of the expenses can be easily calculated by using an annuity immediate:

$$
    \text{EPV Expenses} = A + R \cdot a_x
$$

While this is not challenging per se, it is slightly inconvenient as there is a need to use an annuity immediate while premiums use annuity dues - this would make it harder to simplify or more computationally intensive.

This can be worked around by **splitting the acquisition expense**, such that one part of it forms the first payment for the renewal expenses, allowing an annuity due to be used instead:

<!-- Self Made -->
![Acquisition Expense Splitting](Assets/6.%20Premiums.md/Acquisition%20Expense%20Splitting.png)

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{EPV Expenses}
    &= A + R \cdot a_x \\
    &= A - R + R + R \cdot a_x \\
    &= A - R + R \cdot \ddot{a}_x \\
    &= A + R \cdot (\ddot{a}_x - 1)
\end{aligned}
$$

However, note that the simplification does NOT hold true if expense inflation is taken into account - the level annuity immediate CANNOT simply be replaced with the geometric annuity.

This is because the expenses only start to inflate from the third payment onwards:

### **Expense Premiums**

The difference between gross and net premiums represent the amount of premiums needed to cover just the expenses, known as the **Expense Premiums**, $E$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    G &= P + E \\
    E &= G - P
\end{aligned}
$$

It is also known as the **Expense Loading** as it represents the amount that is added (*loaded*) on to the net premiums to cover expenses.
