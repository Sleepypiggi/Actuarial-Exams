# **Life Assurance Functions**

Life Assurances are contracts that promise to pay out a benefit *if* the insured event occurs in the *future*.

The value of a life assurance must reflect these two aspects:

1. Uncertainty of cashflows - **Expected Value**, based on Survival Models
2. Time value of money - **Present Value**, based on Interest Theory

Thus, the value of a life assurance is the **Expected Present Value** (EPV) of the promised cashflows.

## **Payable Discretely**

The simplest form of life assurance pays the benefits at the **end of the year** that the insured event occurs. For simplicity, the benefit of the contract is assumed to be 1.

> While not common in practice, it provides a simple framework to understand the core concepts.

For an assurance payable discretely, $K_x$ is used as the survival model. Thus, the present value of the benefit payable in each period is $v^{K_x + 1}$.

The EPV of the contract is the **sum product** of the **PV of the benefit** in each period and the **probability of death** in that period:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    EPV
    &= \sum v^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x}p_{x} {}_{}q_{x + K_x} \\
    &= \sum v^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x|}q_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

### **Actuarial Notation**

Similar to the survival model, given how often these values are calculated, they are abbreviated using the **International Actuarial Notation** as well.

$A$ represents the **first moment** (expectation) of the **present value** of a contract where a benefit of 1 is payable discretely when the *status fails*.

The subscript $x$ is the age of the policyholder, known as the **Life Status**. It fails when the policyholder *dies*.

An additional subscript $:\enclose{actuarial}{n}$ is the duration that the assurance remains valid, known as the **Duration Status**. It fails if the policyholder *survives* past the policyterm.

A $1$ above the status indicates that the assurance pays **only** pays if that **particular status fails first**. If nothing is indicated, then the assurance pays whichever status fails first.

> If a particular status is omitted, then the assurance is not dependent on that status. For instance, omitting the duration status means that the contract is only dependent on the age of the policyholder.

An assurance that **begins $n$ years later** is known as a **Deferred Assurance**, which is denoted by ${}_{n|}A$, following the same notation as deferred probabilities.

Thus, putting everything together, the EPV of each assurance can be denoted as follows:

* **Whole Life Assurance** - Payable whenever policyholder dies; $A_x$
* **Term Assurance** - Payable only if policyholder dies during assurance period; $A^{1}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}$
* **Pure Endowment** - Payable only if policyholder survives past assurance period; $A^{\>\>\>\> 1}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}$
* **Endowment Assurance** - Payable whichever of the above two occur first; $A_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}$
* **Deferred Whole Life Assurance** - Payable only if policyholder dies after $n$ years; ${}_{n|}A_x$

Pure Endowments can also be expressed as ${}_{n}E_x$ for easier typesetting.

### **Whole Life Assurance**

**Whole Life Assurances** cover the insured **indefinitely** and thus *will* pay out *whenever* the insured dies.

Let WL be the random variable denoting the PV of the death benefit:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{WL} &= v^{K_x + 1} \\
    K_x &= 0, 1, \dots, \infty
\end{aligned}
$$

> Technically speaking, the upper limit of $K_x$ should $\omega-x$ as it represents the **maximum attainable age** in the discrete survival model.
>
> However, since the ${}_{k}p_{x} = 0$ for all $k \ge \omega-x$, it **does not matter** what the upper limit is as long as it is larger than $\omega-x$. Thus, $\infty$ is used for conciseness instead.

<!-- Self Made -->
![WL Discrete](Assets/3.%20Life%20Insurance%20Functions.md/WL%20Discrete.png){.center}

The EPV is the **Expectation/First Moment** of the WL random variable:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E(\text{WL}) &= \sum^\infty_{K_x = 0} v^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x|}q_{x} \\
    A_{x} &= \sum^\infty_{K_x = 0} v^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x|}q_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

Another commonly used metric is the **Variance** of the contract. In order to get it, the **Second Moment** must first be determined:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E({\text{WL}}^2)
    &= \sum^\infty_{K_x = 0} \left(v^{K_x + 1}\right)^2 \cdot {}_{K_x|}q_{x} \\
    &= \sum^\infty_{K_x = 0} \left((v^2)^{K_x + 1}\right) \cdot {}_{K_x|}q_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

Notice that the expression can be simplified to a form that looks **almost identical to the first moment** - with the only difference being that is uses $v^2$ instead of $v$.

Thus, the second moment is simply the first moment **evaluated at a higher interest rate** $i^*=(1+i)^2-1$, such that $v^* = v^2$.

Generally, the **k-th moment** is denoted as ${}^{k}A_x$, where the $k$ is the **multiplier on the interest rate** used to evaluate the moment, $i^*=(1+i)^k-1$.

The **Second Moment** and hence **Variance** can be shown as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E({\text{WL}}^2) &= \sum^\infty_{K_x = 0} (v^2)^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x|}q_{x} \\
    {}^{2} A_{x} &= \sum^\infty_{K_x = 0} (v^*)^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x|}q_{x} \\
    \\
    \therefore Var(\text{WL}) &= {}^{2} A_{x} - (A_{x})^2
\end{aligned}
$$

### **Term Assurance**

**Term Assurance** covers the insured for a **specified period $n$** and only pays out *if* the insured dies within that period. **NOTHING** is paid out if the insured *survives beyond* that.

> A WL Assurance can be thought of as a special Term Assurance with infinite coverage.

Let TA be the random variable denoting the PV of the death benefit:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{TA} &=
    \begin{cases}
        v^{K_x + 1} ,& K_x = 0, 1, \dots, n-1 \\
        0 ,& K_x \ge n
    \end{cases} \\
    &= {}_{\{K_x \le n-1\}} v^{K_x+1}
\end{aligned}
$$

$\{K_x \le n-1\}$ is known as an **Indicator Function**, which is a binary variable that takes **1 if the condition is true and 0 if the condition if false**. It provides a concise way to express a piecewise function in a single expression.

<!-- Self Made -->
![TA Discrete](Assets/3.%20Life%20Insurance%20Functions.md/TA%20Discrete.png)

The EPV is the **expectation** of the TA random variable:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E(\text{TA}) &= \sum^{n-1}_{K_x = 0} v^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x|}q_{x} + 0 \cdot {}_{n}p_{x} \\
    A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} &= \sum^{n-1}_{K_x = 0} v^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x|}q_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

Similar as before, the second moment and thus **Variance** can be calculated as the following:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E({\text{TA}}^2) &= \sum^{n-1}_{K_x = 0} (v^2)^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x|}q_{x} + 0^2 \cdot {}_{n}p_{x} \\
    {}^{2} A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} &= \sum^\infty_{K_x = 0} (v^*)^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x|}q_{x} \\
    \\
    \therefore Var(\text{TA}) &= {}^{2} A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} - (A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}})^2
\end{aligned}
$$

### **Pure Endowment**

**Pure Endowments** are a special kind of contract that instead only pays out *if* the insured **survives** past a specified period $n$. **NOTHING** is paid out if the insured *dies before* that.

Let PE be the random variable denoting the PV of the survival benefit:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{PE} &=
    \begin{cases}
        0 ,& K_x = 0, 1, 2 \dots, n \\
        v^n ,& K_x \ge n
    \end{cases}
\end{aligned}
$$

<!-- Self Made -->
![PE Discrete](Assets/3.%20Life%20Insurance%20Functions.md/PE%20Discrete.png){.center}

The EPV is the **expectation** of the PE random variable. However, note that the probability of surviving past the period is given by a *single probability* ${}_{n}p_{x}$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E(\text{PE}) &= 0 \cdot {}_{n}q_{x} + v^n {}_{n}p_{x} \\
    {}_{n}E_x &= v^n {}_{n}p_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

Similar as before, the second moment and thus **Variance** can be calculated:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E({\text{PE}}^2) &= 0^2 \cdot {}_{n}q_{x} + (v^2)^n {}_{n}p_{x} \\
    {}^{2}_{n}E_x &= (v^*)^n {}_{n}p_{x} \\
    \\
    \therefore Var(\text{PE}) &= {}^{2}_{n}E_x - ({}_{n}E_x)^2
\end{aligned}
$$

### **Endowment Assurance**

**Endowment Assurances** are a *combination* of term assurances and pure endowments:

* **Term Assurance** - Pays out if the insured dies within the period
* **Pure Endowment** - Pays out if the insured survives past the period
* Thus, endowment assurances WILL pay out no matter what

Let EA be the random variable denoting the PV of the benefits:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{EA}
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        v^{K_x + 1} ,& K_x = 0, 1, \dots, n-1 \\
        v^n ,& K_x \ge n
    \end{cases} \\
    &= v^{min(K_x + 1, n)}
\end{aligned}
$$

<!-- Self Made -->
![EA Discrete](Assets/3.%20Life%20Insurance%20Functions.md/EA%20Discrete.png){.center}

The EPV is the **expectation** of the EA random variable:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E(\text{EA}) &= \sum^{n-1}_{K_x = 0} v^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x|}q_{x} + v^n {}_{n}p_{x} \\
    A_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} &= A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} + {}_{n}E_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

Note that the in the *final year* of the contract, the assurance **will pay $v^n$ regardless** of the outcome - TA pays if they die while PE pays if they survive. Thus, a simplification can be made to the EPV:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    A_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}
    &= \sum^{n-1}_{K_x = 0} v^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x|}q_{x} + v^n {}_{n}p_{x} \\
    &= \sum^{n-2}_{K_x = 0} v^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x}p_{x} {}_{}q_{x + K_x} + v^n {}_{n-1}p_{x} {}_{}q_{x + n - 1} + v^n {}_{n}p_{x} \\
    &= \sum^{n-2}_{K_x = 0} v^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x|}q_{x} + v^n ({}_{n-1}p_{x} {}_{}q_{x + n - 1} + {}_{n}p_{x}) \\
    &= \sum^{n-2}_{K_x = 0} v^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x|}q_{x} + v^n {}_{n-1}p_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

<!-- Self Made -->
![EA Discrete Simplified](Assets/3.%20Life%20Insurance%20Functions.md/EA%20Discrete%20Simplified.png){.center}

Similar as before, the second moment and thus **Variance** can be calculated:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E(\text{EA}^2) &= \sum^{n-1}_{K_x = 0} (v^2)^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x|}q_{x} + (v^2)^n {}_{n}p_{x} \\
    {}^{2} A_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} &= \sum^{n-1}_{K_x = 0} (v^*)^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x|}q_{x} + (v^*)^n {}_{n}p_{x} \\
    \\
    \therefore Var(\text{EA})
    &= {}^{2} A_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} - \left(A_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}\right)^2 \\
    &= \left({}^{2} A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} + {}^{2}_{n}E_x \right) - \left(A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} - ({}_{n}E_x) \right)^2 \\
    &= \left({}^{2} A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} + {}^{2}_{n}E_x \right) - \left[(A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}})^2 + 2(A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} \cdot {}_{n}E_x) + ({}_{n}E_x)^2 \right]
\end{aligned}
$$

The same outcome can be reached using a slightly different approach:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    Var(EA)
    &= Var(\text{TA} + \text{PE}) \\
    &= Var(\text{TA}) + Var(\text{PE}) + 2 Cov(\text{TA}, \text{PE}) \\
    &= Var(\text{TA}) + Var(\text{PE}) + 2 [E(\text{TA} \cdot \text{PE}) - E(\text{TA}) \cdot E(\text{PE})]
\end{aligned}
$$

Consider the distribution of TA and PE:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    TA \cdot PE
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        v^{K_x + 1} \cdot 0, K_x \lt n \\
        0 \cdot v^n, K_x \ge n
    \end{cases} \\
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        0, K_x \lt n \\
        0, K_x \ge n
    \end{cases} \\
    \\ \therefore E(\text{TA} \cdot \text{PE})
    &= 0 \cdot {}_{n}q_x + 0 \cdot {}_{n}p_x \\
    &= 0
\end{aligned}  
$$

This results in the same variance as before:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    Var(EA)
    &= Var(\text{TA}) + Var(\text{PE}) + 2 [E(\text{TA} \cdot \text{PE}) - E(\text{TA}) \cdot E(\text{PE})] \\
    &= {}^{2} A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} - (A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}})^2 + {}^{2}_{n}E_x - ({}_{n}E_x)^2 - 2(A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} \cdot {}_{n}E_x) \\
    &= \left({}^{2} A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} + {}^{2}_{n}E_x \right) - \left[(A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}})^2 + 2(A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} \cdot {}_{n}E_x) + ({}_{n}E_x)^2 \right] \\
\end{aligned}
$$

While this process might seem redundant, it provides an easy to understand example of how the variance of a combination of assurances is derived by considering the covariance.

### **Deferred Assurances**

Deferred Assurances are variations of any of the above assurances, where the assurance **starts $n$ years later rather** than immediately. While any assurance can be deferred, the two most common are the **Deferred Whole Life** and **Deferred Term Assurances**.

#### **Deferred Whole Life Assurance**

Let DWL be the random variable denoting the PV of the benefits of a deferred whole life assurance:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{DWL}
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        0,& K_x = 0, 1, 2, \dots, n-1 \\
        v^{K_x + 1} ,& K_x \ge n
    \end{cases} \\
    &= {}_{\{K_x \ge n\}} v^{K_x + 1}
\end{aligned}
$$

<!-- Self Made -->
![DWL Discrete](Assets/3.%20Life%20Insurance%20Functions.md/DWL%20Discrete.png)

The EPV is the **expectation** of the EA random variable:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E(\text{DWL}) &= 0 \cdot {}_{n}p_{x} + \sum^{\infty}_{K_x = n} v^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x|}q_{x} \\
    {}_{n|} A_{x}
    &= \sum^{\infty}_{K_x = 0} v^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x|}q_{x} - \sum^{n-1}_{K_x = 0} v^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x|}q_{x} \\
    &= A_x - A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}
\end{aligned}
$$

Since a DWL is simply a WL assurance issued $n$ years later, the EPV of the DWL is equivalent to the EPV of a WL issued at age $x+n$ (after adjusting for interest **AND** survival):

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{n|} A_{x}
    &= \sum^{\infty}_{K_x = n} v^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x|}q_{x} \\
    &= v^n {}_{n} p_{x} \sum^{\infty}_{K_x = n} v^{K_x - n + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x-n|}q_{x+n} \\
    &= v^n {}_{n} p_{x} \sum^{\infty}_{K_x = 0} v^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x|}q_{x+n} \\
    &= {}_{n}E_{x} \cdot A_{x+n} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

> PEs can be use as a **discount factor** for functions that **takes mortality into consideration**. If provided by the life table, this reduces the need for computation.
>
> When going "back" in time, it must reflect that the policyholder will eventually survive till the current age, which is why the probability of surviving the period must be multiplied.

This allows a TA to be expressed as the **difference of two WL assurances issued at different times**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{n|} A_{x} &= {}_{n}E_{x} * A_{x+n} \\
    A_x - A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} &= {}_{n}E_{x} * A_{x+n} \\
    A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} &= A_{x} - {}_{n}E_{x} * A_{x+n} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

<!-- Self Made -->
![DWL Difference](Assets/3.%20Life%20Insurance%20Functions.md/DWL%20Difference.png)

$$
\begin{aligned}
    Var (DWL)
    &= {}^{2}_{n|}A_x - ({}_{n|}A_x)^2 \\
    &= \left({}^{2}A_x - {}^{2}A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}\right) - \left(A_x - A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}\right)^2 \\
    &= \left({}^{2}A_x - {}^{2}A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}\right) + \left[(A_x)^2 - 2(A_x)(A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}) + (A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}})^2 \right]
\end{aligned}
$$

#### **Deferred Term Assurance**

Let **DTA** be the random variable denoting the PV of the benefits of a deferred term assurance.

Note that most of the properties of the DWL apply to DTA as well:

1. Difference of two terms - ${}_{n|} A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} = A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n+k}} - A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}$



A WL assurance can be thought of as the **infinite sum** of a series of deferred term assurances, each deferred one year more than the previous :

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E(\text{WL})
    &= E(\text{DTA}_0) + E(\text{DTA}_1) + E(\text{DTA}_2) + E(\text{DTA}_3) + \dots + E(\text{DTA}_\infty) \\
    &= \sum^\infty_{n = 1} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

### **Recursions**

The EPV of each contract can also be expressed through **backwards recursion**, where it is calculated as a function of itself.

Consider the **WL** random variable:

* If the policyholder dies in the year with probability ${}_{}q_{x}$, then a benefit of 1 is paid at the end of the year.
* If the policyholder survives past the year with probability ${}_{}p_{x}$, then the policyholder will die in some future year. The PV of the benefit at the end of the year is given is the **EPV of the same contract but at that future time**; $A_{x+1}$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    WL
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        v \cdot 1 ,& {}_{}q_{x} \\
        v \cdot A_{x+1} ,& {}_{}p_{x}
    \end{cases}
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
    \therefore A_x = v{}_{}q_{x} + v{}_{}p_{x}A_{x+1}
$$

<!-- Self Made -->
![WL Recursion](Assets/3.%20Life%20Insurance%20Functions.md/WL%20Recursion.png)

The same exercise can be shown for the **TA** random variable. The main difference is understanding how the notation changed:

* $x+1$ reflects the new age of the policyholder (same as WL)
* $n-1$ reflects that one year of coverage has passed (not applicable for WL)

$$
\begin{aligned}
    TA
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        v \cdot 1 ,& {}_{}q_{x} \\
        v \cdot A^1_{x+1:\enclose{actuarial}{n-1}} ,& {}_{}p_{x}
    \end{cases}
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
    \therefore A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n-1}} = v{}_{}q_{x} + v{}_{}p_{x}A^1_{x+1:\enclose{actuarial}{n-1}}
$$

The **PE** variable is similar, with the main difference being that the policyholder will **receive nothing if the policyholder dies**. Thus, only the second component of the recursion remains:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    PE
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        0 ,& {}_{}q_{x} \\
        v \cdot {}_{n-1}E_{x+1} ,& {}_{}p_{x}
    \end{cases}
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
    \therefore {}_{n}E_{x} = v{}_{}p_{x} \cdot {}_{n-1}E_{x+1}
$$

EA is omitted from this section as it is simply the combination of a TA and PE.

These identities are most useful in a spreadsheet setting where the calculations can be easily repeated to fill up an entire life table. However, even then it is necessary to have a *starting point* for the recusions to occur.

The most common starting point is the terminal age as the EPVs can be intuitively determined since the policyholder will **inevitably die** at the end of the year:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    A_{\omega-1} &= v \\
    A^{\> \> 1}_{\omega-1:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} &= v \\
    {}_{n}E_{\omega-1} &= 0 \\
    A^{1}_{\omega-1:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} &= v
\end{aligned}
$$

### **Intuitions**

Although the exam questions are mostly computational, it is good to have an understanding of how the different EPVs compare against one another to serve as a sort of "sense check" to determine if the answer is in the right direction.

#### **Same assurance comparisons**

Recall that the probability of death is an *increasing* function with age. The death benefit is **more likely to be paid out** to an older policyholder - in other words, they **receive the death benefit "sooner"** than a younger policyholder.

Thus, an older policyholder has **larger expected cashflows** that are **discounted less** (due to receiving it sooner), which results in a **higher EPV** than a younger policyholder, all else equal:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    A_{x+k} & \gt A_{x} \\
    A^{\> \> 1} _{x+k:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} & \gt A^{\> \> 1}_{x+k:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}
\end{aligned}
$$

Conversely, the probability of survival is a *decreasing* function with age. The survival benefit is **less likely to be paid out** to an older policyholder - smaller expected cashflows.

Regardless of the age of the policyholder, the survival benefit is paid at the same time (**same discounting**). Thus, since an older policyholder has **smaller expected cashflows**, it has a **lower EPV** than a younger policyholder:

$$
    {}_{n}E_{x+k} \le {}_{n}E_{x}
$$

Endowment Assurances have **both a death and survival component**, thus the comparison is a combination of the two:

* A younger policyholder is **more likely to survive** and receive the survival benefit at the end of the term (discounted more)
* An older policyholder is **more likely to die** and receive the death benefit during the term (discounted less)

Assuming that the difference in expected cashflows are *negligible*, then an older policyholder would have an **higher EPV** due to the **lower discounting**:

$$

Naturally, all else equal, assurances with a **lower interest rate are discounted less** and thus have a **higher EPV**. This is particularly useful for questions where the SULT cannot be directly used, but can still be used as a sense check for the answers.

#### **Different assurance comparisons**

At a **young age** where the probability of death is low, all else equal (where applicable), the EPVs of each assurance rank as follows:

1. **TA will have the smallest EPV**. Although their benefits are paid out sooner, the **expected benefits are small** as the probability of death is small.
2. **WL has the next largest EPV**. They have the same benefits as term in the short run, but have **large expected benefits in the future**. However, these large benefits are **heavily discounted**, still resuling in a small EPV.
3. **PE has the next largest EPV**. Given the high probability of survival, the **expected benefits are large**.
4. **EA has the largest EPV**. Since it is a combination of TA and PE, it is naturally the highest.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    A^{1}_{30:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} < A_{30} < {}_{n}E_{30} < A_{30:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

At an **old age** where the probability of death is high, all else equal (where applicable), the EPVs of each assurance rank as follows:

1. **PE will have the smallest EPV**. Given the low probability of survival, the **expected benefits are are small**.
2. **TA will have the next largest EPV**. Given the high probability of death, the **expected benefits are high**.
3. **EA will have the next largest EPV**. Since it is combination of TA and PE, it is naturally higher than both of them.
4. **WL has the largest EPV**. Given the inevitable death of the policyholder, the **expected benefits are the highest**.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{n}E_{100} < A^{1}_{100:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} < A_{100:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} < A_{100} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

As the policyholder approaches the terminal age, the EPVs tend to one another:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    x &\to \omega \\
    E(\text{PE}) &\to 0 \\
    E(\text{EA}) &\to E(\text{TA}) \\
    E(\text{TA}) &\to E(\text{WL})
\end{aligned}
$$

TA tends to WL whenever the **end of the term exceeds the terminal age** - thus the cashflows and hence EPV for both assurances become identical.

## **Payable Continuously**

### **Continuous Whole Life**

### **Continuous Term**

### **Continuous Endowments**

NO SUCH THING AS CONTINUOUS PURE ENDOWMENTS

## **Discrete to Continuous Approximation**

### **Uniform Death Distribution**

Alternatively, it can be assumed that people **die with constant probability within a year**.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    f_{T_x} &= S_x(t)\mu_{x+t} &
\end{aligned}
$$

Can think of Whole life as a series of terms

Uniform distribution each year

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \int^1_0 v^t {}_{t}p_{x+k} \mu_{x+k+t}
    &\approx \int^1_0 v^t {}_{}q_{x+k}
    &\approx {}_{}q_{x+k} \int^1_0 e^{\deltat}
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \bar{A}_x
    &= {}_{0|}\bar{A}^1_{x+1:\enclose{actuarial}{1}} + {}_{1|}\bar{A}^1_{x+1:\enclose{actuarial}{1}} + {}_{2|}\bar{A}^1_{x+1:\enclose{actuarial}{1}} + \dots \\
    &= q_x \frac{iv}{\delta} + vp_xq_{x+1} \frac{iv}{\delta} + v^2 {}_{2}p_{x} q_{x+2} \frac{iv}{\delta} + \dots \\
    &= \frac{i}{\delta} (q_x + v^1 p_x {}_{}q_{x+1} + v^2 {}_{2}p_{x} {}_{}q_{x+2} + \dots) \\
    &= \frac{i}{\delta} A_x \\
\end{aligned}
$$

### **Claims Acceleration**

usually paid at $K_x + \frac{1}{m}$
Assume that deaths occur evenly thus should occur in $K_x + \frac{m+1}{2m}$
Since this is $\frac{m-1}{2m}$ earlier than the discrete case

the discount factor for the discrete needs to be adjusted by that amount
to be the same

as the number of payments increase $m \to \infty$ then the adjustment tends to $\frac{1}{2}$

Benefits that are paid out immediately versus at the end of the period are significantly different as the continuous benefits are *discounted more*.

However, it can be assumed that *on average*, all the deaths in the year occur in the **middle of the year** - $x+k+\frac{1}{2}$. The PV of the benefits are discounted using multiples of $v^{\frac{1}{2}}$ instead:

<!-- Self Made -->

Applying this to a continuous contract, it can be shown that it's EPV is is a function of the EPV of a discrete contract. This is known as the **Claims Acceleration Approach**.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \bar{A}_x
    &\approx v^{\frac{1}{2}} q_x + v^{\frac{3}{2}} p_x {}_{}q_{x+1} + v^{\frac{5}{2}} {}_{2}p_{x} {}_{}q_{x+2} + \dots \\
    &\approx (1+i)^{\frac{1}{2}} (vq_x + v^1 p_x {}_{}q_{x+1} + v^2 {}_{2}p_{x} {}_{}q_{x+2} + \dots) \\
    &\approx (1+i)^{\frac{1}{2}} A_x
\end{aligned}
$$

The method applies a higher discount rate to the discrete contract, to account for the "under-discounting" of the discrete method. While it is not is not perfect, it is more reflective of actual experience than the discrete method.
