# **Life Insurance Functions**

Life Insurance contracts promise to pay out a benefit *if* the insured event (Death) occurs in the *future*.

The value of a life insurance contract must reflect these two aspects:

1. Uncertainty of cashflows - **Expected Value**, based on Survival Models
2. Time value of money - **Present Value**, based on Interest Theory

Thus, the value of a life insurance contract is the **Expected Present Value** (EPV) of the promised cashflows.

There are two categories of insurance contracts, based on *when* the benefits are paid out:

<center>

| Discrete | Continuous |
| :-: | :-: |
| Paid at the **end of the period** that the insured died | Paid out at **immediately** upon the death of the insured |

</center>

## **Payable Discretely**

If the contract pays out benefits discretely, then $K_x$ is used as the survival model.

Given a benefit of $1, the PV of the benefit is $v^{K_x + 1}$.

Thus, the EPV of the contract is the **sum product** of the **PV of the benefit** in each period and the **probability of death** in that period:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    EPV
    &= \sum v^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x}p_{x} {}_{}q_{x + K_x} \\
    &= \sum v^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x|}q_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

<!-- If the SA is not 1 then the random variable is different and hence the variance -->

### **Whole Life Assurance**

**Whole Life** Assurance covers the insured **indefinitely** and thus *will* pay out whenever the insured **dies**.

Let WL be the random variable denoting the PV of the death benefit:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{WL} &= v^{K_x + 1} \\
    K_x &= 0, 1, \dots, \infty
\end{aligned}
$$

> Technically speaking, the upper limit of $K_x$ should $\omega-x$ as it represents the **maximum attainable age** in the discrete survival model.
>
> However, since the ${}_{k}p_{x} = 0$ for all $k \ge \omega-x$, it **does not matter** what the upper limit is as long as it is larger than $\omega-x$. Thus, in order to be concise, $\infty$ is often used instead.

Thus, the EPV is the **Expectation/First Moment** of the WL random variable:

$$
    E(\text{WL}) = \sum^\infty_{K_x = 0} v^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x|}q_{x}
$$

The **Second Moment** can be similarly caclulated:

$$
    E({\text{WL}}^2) = \sum^\infty_{K_x = 0} (v^{K_x + 1})^2 \cdot {}_{K_x|}q_{x}
$$

This can be simplified to a formula *similar* to the first moment by substituting $v' = v^2$, which can be further **generalized to the k-th moment** of the random variable by substituting $v' = v^k$ instead.

The simplified second moment and thus **Variance** be calculated:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E({\text{WL}}^2)
    &= \sum^\infty_{K_x = 0} (v^2)^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x|}q_{x} \\
    &= \sum^\infty_{K_x = 0} (v')^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x|}q_{x} \\
    \\
    \therefore Var(\text{WL}) &= E({\text{WL}}^2) - [E(\text{WL})]^2
\end{aligned}
$$

### **Term Assurance**

**Term Assurance** covers the insured for a **specified period $n$** and only pays out *if* the insured dies within that period. Nothing is paid out if the insured survives beyond that.

Let TA be the random variable denoting the PV of the death benefit:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{TA} &=
    \begin{cases}
        v^{K_x + 1} ,& K_x = 0, 1, \dots, n-1 \\
        0 ,& K_x \ge n
    \end{cases}
\end{aligned}
$$

<!-- Insert Diagram -->

Thus, the EPV is the **expectation** of the TA random variable:

$$
    E(\text{TA}) = \sum^{n-1}_{K_x = 0} v^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x|}q_{x}
$$

Similarly, the simplified second moment and thus **Variance** can be calculated using the $v' = v^2$ substitution:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E({\text{TA}}^2) 
    &= \sum^{n-1}_{K_x = 0} (v^2)^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x|}q_{x} \\
    &= \sum^\infty_{K_x = 0} (v')^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x|}q_{x} \\
    \\
    \therefore Var(\text{TA}) &= E({\text{TA}}^2) - E(\text{TA})
\end{aligned}
$$

### **Pure Endowment**

**Pure Endowments** are a special kind of insurance that instead only pays out *if* the insured **survives past a certain period**. Nothing is paid out if the insured dies before that.

Let PE be the random variable denoting the PV of the survival benefit:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{PE} &=
    \begin{cases}
        0 ,& K_x < n \\
        v^n ,& K_x \ge n
    \end{cases}
\end{aligned}
$$

The probability of surviving past the period is given by a *single probability* ${}_{n}p_{x}$. Thus, the EPV is the **expectation** of the PE random variable:

$$
    E(\text{PE}) = v^n \cdot {}_{n}p_{x}
$$

Add more intuition

Similarly, the simplified second moment and thus **Variance** can be calculated using the $v' = v^2$ substitution:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E({\text{PE}}^2)
    &= (v^2)^n \cdot {}_{n}p_{x} \\
    &= (v')^n \cdot {}_{n}p_{x} \\
    \\
    \therefore Var(\text{PE}) &= E({\text{PE}}^2) - E(\text{PE})
\end{aligned}
$$

### **Endowment Assurance**

**Endowment Assurances** are a *combination* of term assurances and pure endowments:

* **Term Assurance** - Pays out if the insured dies within the period
* **Pure Endowment** - Pays out if the insured survives past the period

Similar to whole life policies, endowment assurances *will* make a payout.

Let EA be the random variable denoting the PV of the benefits:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{EA}
    &= \text{TA} + \text{PE} \\
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        v^{K_x + 1} ,& K_x = 0, 1, \dots, n-1 \\
        v^n ,& K_x \ge n
    \end{cases}
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, the EPV is the **expectation** of the EA random variable:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E(\text{EA})
    &= E(\text{TA}) + E(\text{PE}) \\
    &= \sum^{n-1}_{K_x = 0} v^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x|}q_{x} + v^n \cdot {}_{n}p_{x} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

### **Deferred Assurances**

Deferred Assurances are variations of the above contracts where the **coverage is deferred by $n$ years**. While any contract can be deferred, the most useful is the **Deferred Whole Life Assurance**.

Let DWL be the random variable denoting the PV of the benefits:
