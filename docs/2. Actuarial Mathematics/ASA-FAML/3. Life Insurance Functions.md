# **Life Insurance Functions**

Life Insurance contracts promise to pay out a benefit *if* the insured event (Death) occurs in the *future*.

The value of a life insurance contract must reflect these two aspects:

1. Uncertainty of cashflows - **Expected Value**, based on Survival Models
2. Time value of money - **Present Value**, based on Interest Theory

Thus, the value of a life insurance contract is the **Expected Present Value** (EPV) of the promised cashflows.

There are two categories of insurance contracts, based on *when* the benefits are paid out:

<center>

| Discrete | Continuous |
| :-: | :-: |
| Paid at the **end of the period** that the insured died | Paid out at **immediately** upon the death of the insured |

</center>

## **Payable Discretely**

If the contract pays out benefits discretely, then $K_x$ is used as the survival model.

Given a benefit of $1, the PV of the benefit is $v^{K_x + 1}$.

Thus, the EPV of the contract is the **sum product** of the **PV of the benefit** in each period and the **probability of death** in that period:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    EPV
    &= \sum v^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x}p_{x} {}_{}q_{x + K_x} \\
    &= \sum v^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x|}q_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

<!-- If the SA is not 1 then the random variable is different and hence the variance -->

### **Whole Life Assurance**

**Whole Life** Assurance covers the insured **indefinitely** and thus *will* pay out whenever the insured **dies**.

Let WL be the random variable denoting the PV of the death benefit:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{WL} &= v^{K_x + 1} \\
    K_x &= 0, 1, \dots, \infty
\end{aligned}
$$

> Technically speaking, the upper limit of $K_x$ should $\omega-x$ as it represents the **maximum attainable age** in the discrete survival model.
>
> However, since the ${}_{k}p_{x} = 0$ for all $k \ge \omega-x$, it **does not matter** what the upper limit is as long as it is larger than $\omega-x$. Thus, in order to be concise, $\infty$ is often used instead.

![WL Discrete](Assets/3.%20Life%20Insurance%20Functions.md/WL%20Discrete.png){.center}

Thus, the EPV is the **Expectation/First Moment** of the WL random variable:

$$
    E(\text{WL}) = \sum^\infty_{K_x = 0} v^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x}p_{x} {}_{}q_{x + K_x}
$$

The **Second Moment** can be similarly caclulated:

$$
    E({\text{WL}}^2) = \sum^\infty_{K_x = 0} (v^{K_x + 1})^2 \cdot {}_{K_x}p_{x} {}_{}q_{x + K_x}
$$

This can be simplified to a formula *similar* to the first moment by substituting $v' = v^2$, which can be further **generalized to the k-th moment** of the random variable by substituting $v' = v^k$ instead.

The simplified second moment and thus **Variance** be calculated:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E({\text{WL}}^2)
    &= \sum^\infty_{K_x = 0} (v^2)^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x}p_{x} {}_{}q_{x + K_x} \\
    &= \sum^\infty_{K_x = 0} (v')^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x}p_{x} {}_{}q_{x + K_x} \\
    \\
    \therefore Var(\text{WL}) &= E({\text{WL}}^2) - [E(\text{WL})]^2
\end{aligned}
$$

### **Term Assurance**

**Term Assurance** covers the insured for a **specified period $n$** and only pays out *if* the insured dies within that period. Nothing is paid out if the insured survives beyond that.

Let TA be the random variable denoting the PV of the death benefit:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{TA} &=
    \begin{cases}
        v^{K_x + 1} ,& K_x = 0, 1, \dots, n-1 \\
        0 ,& K_x \ge n
    \end{cases}
\end{aligned}
$$

<!-- Self Made -->
![TA Discrete](Assets/3.%20Life%20Insurance%20Functions.md/TA%20Discrete.png)

Thus, the EPV is the **expectation** of the TA random variable:

$$
    E(\text{TA}) = \sum^{n-1}_{K_x = 0} v^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x}p_{x} {}_{}q_{x + K_x}
$$

Similarly, the simplified second moment and thus **Variance** can be calculated using the $v' = v^2$ substitution:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E({\text{TA}}^2) 
    &= \sum^{n-1}_{K_x = 0} (v^2)^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x}p_{x} {}_{}q_{x + K_x} \\
    &= \sum^\infty_{K_x = 0} (v')^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x}p_{x} {}_{}q_{x + K_x} \\
    \\
    \therefore Var(\text{TA}) &= E({\text{TA}}^2) - E(\text{TA})
\end{aligned}
$$

### **Pure Endowment**

**Pure Endowments** are a special kind of insurance that instead only pays out *if* the insured **survives past a certain period**. Nothing is paid out if the insured dies before that.

Let PE be the random variable denoting the PV of the survival benefit:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{PE} &=
    \begin{cases}
        0 ,& K_x < n \\
        v^n ,& K_x \ge n
    \end{cases}
\end{aligned}
$$

<!-- Self Made -->
![PE Discrete](Assets/3.%20Life%20Insurance%20Functions.md/PE%20Discrete.png){.center}

The probability of surviving past the period is given by a *single probability* ${}_{n}p_{x}$. Thus, the EPV is the **expectation** of the PE random variable:

$$
    E(\text{PE}) = v^n {}_{n}p_{x}
$$

Add more intuition

Similarly, the simplified second moment and thus **Variance** can be calculated using the $v' = v^2$ substitution:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E({\text{PE}}^2)
    &= (v^2)^n {}_{n}p_{x} \\
    &= (v')^n {}_{n}p_{x} \\
    \\
    \therefore Var(\text{PE}) &= E({\text{PE}}^2) - E(\text{PE})
\end{aligned}
$$

### **Endowment Assurance**

**Endowment Assurances** are a *combination* of term assurances and pure endowments:

* **Term Assurance** - Pays out if the insured dies within the period
* **Pure Endowment** - Pays out if the insured survives past the period

Similar to whole life policies, endowment assurances *will* make a payout.

Let EA be the random variable denoting the PV of the benefits:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{EA}
    &= \text{TA} + \text{PE} \\
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        v^{K_x + 1} ,& K_x = 0, 1, \dots, n-1 \\
        v^n ,& K_x \ge n
    \end{cases} \\
    &= v^{min(K_x + 1, n)}
\end{aligned}
$$

<!-- Self Made -->
![EA Discrete](Assets/3.%20Life%20Insurance%20Functions.md/EA%20Discrete.png){.center}

Thus, the EPV is the **expectation** of the EA random variable:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E(\text{EA})
    &= E(\text{TA}) + E(\text{PE}) \\
    &= \sum^{n-1}_{K_x = 0} v^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x}p_{x} {}_{}q_{x + K_x} + v^n {}_{n}p_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

Note that the in the *final year* of the contract, the individual will receive $v^n$ if they die (from the TA) or receive the same $v^n$ if they survive (from the PE).

Thus, a simplification can be made to the EPV:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E(\text{EA})
    &= \sum^{n-1}_{K_x = 0} v^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x}p_{x} {}_{}q_{x + K_x} + v^n {}_{n}p_{x} \\
    &= \sum^{n-2}_{K_x = 0} v^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x}p_{x} {}_{}q_{x + K_x} + v^n {}_{n-1}p_{x} {}_{}q_{x + n - 1} + v^n {}_{n}p_{x} \\
    &= \sum^{n-2}_{K_x = 0} v^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x}p_{x} {}_{}q_{x + K_x} + v^n ({}_{n-1}p_{x} {}_{}q_{x + n - 1} + {}_{n}p_{x}) \\
    &= \sum^{n-2}_{K_x = 0} v^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x}p_{x} {}_{}q_{x + K_x} + v^n {}_{n-1}p_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

### **Deferred Assurances**

Deferred Assurances are variations of the above contracts where the **coverage is deferred by $n$ years**. While any contract can be deferred, the most useful is the **Deferred Whole Life Assurance**.

Let DWL be the random variable denoting the PV of the benefits of a deferred whole life assurance:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{DWL}
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        0, K_x = 0 ,& 1, 2, \dots, n-1 \\
        v^{K_x + 1} ,& K_x \ge n
    \end{cases}
\end{aligned}
$$

<!-- Self Made -->
![DWL Discrete](Assets/3.%20Life%20Insurance%20Functions.md/DWL%20Discrete.png){.center}

Thus, the EPV is the **expectation** of the DWL random variable:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E(\text{DWL})
    &= \sum^{\infty}_{K_x = n} v^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x}p_{x} {}_{}q_{x + K_x} \\
    &= \sum^{\infty}_{K_x = 0} v^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x}p_{x} {}_{}q_{x + K_x} - \sum^{n-1}_{K_x = 0} v^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x}p_{x} {}_{}q_{x + K_x} \\
    &= E(WL) - E(TA)
\end{aligned}
$$

Intuitively, a DWL can be thought of as an WL that is **issued $n$ years later**. Thus, the EPV of this WL policy can be brought forward time by **adjusting for both interest and survival**:

$$
    E(\text{DWL}) = v^n {}_{n}p_{x} * E(WL_{x+n})
$$

This allows a TA to be expressed as the **difference of two WL policies issued at different times**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E(\text{DWL}) &= v^n {}_{n}p_{x} * E(WL_{x+n}) \\
    E(WL) - E(TA) &= v^n {}_{n}p_{x} * E(WL_{x+n}) \\
    E(TA) &= E(WL) - v^n {}_{n}p_{x} * E(WL_{x+n})
\end{aligned}
$$

### **Actuarial Notation**

Similar to the survival model, given how often these values are calculated, they are abbreviated using the **International Actuarial Notation** as well.

${}^{k}A$ represents the **k-th moment** of a contract where a benefit of 1 is paid discretely when the **status fails** (Life Insurance). $k$ is the multiplier on the interest rate for that moment.

> As before, if $k=1$, it is omitted; EG. ${}^{1}A = A$. 
>
> This notation will mainly be used for the first and second moments for the EPV and variance respectively.

The subscript $x$ is the age of the policyholder, known as the **Life Status**. The life status fails when the policyholder dies. The additional subscript $\enclose{actuarial}{n}$ represents the **duration of the policy**, known as the **Duration Status**. It fails if the policyholder *survives* past the policyterm.

A 1 above the status indicates that the policy pays **only** pays if that particular status **fails first**. If no "1" is included, then the policy pays whichever status fails first.

> If the duration status is omitted, then the policy is assumed to last forever.

Thus putting everything together, the EPV of each policy can be denoted as follows:

* **Whole Life Assurance** - Payable whenever policyholder dies; $A_x$
* **Term Assurance** - Payable only if policyholder dies during policy period; $A^{1}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}$
* **Pure Endowment** - Payable only if policyholder survives past policy period; $A^{\>\>\>\> 1}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}$
* **Endowment Assurance** - Payable whichever of the above two occur first; $A_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}$

### **Recursions**

The EPV of each contract can also be expressed through **backwards recursion**, where it is calculated as a function of itself.

Consider the **WL** random variable:

* If the policyholder dies in the year with probability ${}_{}q_{x}$, then a benefit of 1 is paid at the end of the year.
* If the policyholder survives past the year with probability ${}_{}p_{x}$, then the policyholder will die in some future year. The PV of the benefit at the end of the year is given is the **EPV of the same contract but at that future time**; $A_{x+1}$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    WL
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        v \cdot 1 ,& {}_{}q_{x} \\
        v \cdot A_{x+1} ,& {}_{}p_{x}
    \end{cases}
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\therefore A_x = v{}_{}q_{x} + v{}_{}p_{x}A_{x+1}
$$

<!-- Self Made -->
![WL Recursion](Assets/3.%20Life%20Insurance%20Functions.md/WL%20Recursion.png)

Consider the same exercise for the **TA** random variable:

The main difference is that the EPV of the same contract at a future time is denoted by $A^1_{x+1:\enclose{actuarial}{n-1}}$, where the $n-1$ reflects that the **policyholder survived the first year** of the policy, thus only $n-1$ years of coverage remain.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    TA
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        v \cdot 1 ,& {}_{}q_{x} \\
        v \cdot A^1_{x+1:\enclose{actuarial}{n-1}} ,& {}_{}p_{x}
    \end{cases}
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
    \therefore A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n-1}} = v{}_{}q_{x} + v{}_{}p_{x}A^1_{x+1:\enclose{actuarial}{n-1}}
$$

Consider the same exercise for the **PE** random variable:

The main difference is that if the policyholder dies in the current year, **no benefit** will be paid out at the end of the year. Thus, there only the second component remains.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    PE
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        0 ,& {}_{}q_{x} \\
        v \cdot A^{\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\> 1}_{x+1:\enclose{actuarial}{n-1}} ,& {}_{}p_{x}
    \end{cases}
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
    \therefore A^{\>\>\> 1}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} = v{}_{}p_{x}A^{\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\> 1}_{x+1:\enclose{actuarial}{n-1}}
$$

> EA is omitted as it is simply the combination of a TA and PE.

These identities are most useful in a spreadsheet setting where the calculations can be easily repeated to fill up an entire life table.

### **Intuitions**

WL at the end of the life table is
Term same 1
PE 0

Death products increase over time
Survival products decrease
EA tends to term

Term becomes WL when policy period exceeds end

Two policies of the same type
Higher probability of occuring is higher

EA:
For policies which are guaranteed to pay, it depends on the tendency to pay out earlier > Paid out earlier, discounted less, higher EPV
    5 year EA 30
    5 year EA 60

Comparing values
Depends on age

Young Age (Probability death low)
TA is the lowest, as least likely to pay out
WL is the next lowest, unlikely to pay out as well but at least WILL pay out
PE is the next lowest because the probability of survival is high
EA is the highest because PE + TA > PE

Old age (Probability death high)
PE is the lowest because least likely to pay ouf
Term is next because likely to pay out

EA and WL depends
Both share the same probability
depends on the additional > If the death probability is high enough, then the PE component of the EA becomes worhtless, the PV of the indefinite coverage is higher
EA is the next highest because combination

## **Payable Continuously**

### **Continuous Whole Life**

### **Continuous Term**

### **Continuous Endowment**

No such thing as continuous PE

### **Claims Acceleration**

Approximate continuous claims by assuming they occur in the middle of the period
x + k and x + k + 1 at x+k+1/2

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \bar{A}_x
    &\approx v^{\frac{1}{2}} q_x + v^{\frac{3}{2}} p_x {}_{}q_{x+1} + v^{\frac{5}{2}} {}_{2}p_{x} {}_{}q_{x+2} + \dots \\
    &\approx (1+i)^{\frac{1}{2}} (vq_x + v^1 p_x {}_{}q_{x+1} + v^2 {}_{2}p_{x} {}_{}q_{x+2} + \dots) \\
    &\approx (1+i)^{\frac{1}{2}} A_x
\end{aligned}
$$

### **Uniform Death Distribution**

Can think of Whole life as a series of terms

Uniform distribution each year

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \int^1_0 v^t {}_{t}p_{x+k} \mu_{x+k+t}
    &\approx \int^1_0 v^t {}_{}q_{x+k}
    &\approx {}_{}q_{x+k} \int^1_0 e^{\deltat}
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \bar{A}_x
    &= {}_{0|}\bar{A}^1_{x+1:\enclose{actuarial}{1}} + {}_{1|}\bar{A}^1_{x+1:\enclose{actuarial}{1}} + {}_{2|}\bar{A}^1_{x+1:\enclose{actuarial}{1}} + \dots \\
    &= q_x \frac{iv}{\delta} + vp_xq_{x+1} \frac{iv}{\delta} + v^2 {}_{2}p_{x} q_{x+2} \frac{iv}{\delta} + \dots \\
    &= \frac{i}{\delta} (q_x + v^1 p_x {}_{}q_{x+1} + v^2 {}_{2}p_{x} {}_{}q_{x+2} + \dots) \\
    &= \frac{i}{\delta} A_x \\
\end{aligned}
$$
