# **Life Insurance Functions**

Life Insurance contracts promise to pay out a benefit *if* the insured event (Death) occurs in the *future*.

The value of a life insurance contract must reflect these two aspects:

1. Uncertainty of cashflows - **Expected Value**, based on Survival Models
2. Time value of money - **Present Value**, based on Interest Theory

Thus, the value of a life insurance contract is the **Expected Present Value** (EPV) of the promised cashflows.

There are two categories of insurance contracts, based on *when* the benefits are paid out:

<center>

| Discrete | Continuous |
| :-: | :-: |
| Paid at the **end of the period** that the insured died | Paid out at **immediately** upon the death of the insured |

</center>

## **Payable Discretely**

If the contract pays out benefits discretely, then $K_x$ is used as the survival model.

Given a benefit of $1, the PV of the benefit is $v^{K_x + 1}$.

Thus, the EPV of the contract is the **sum product** of the **PV of the benefit** in each period and the **probability of death** in that period:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    EPV
    &= \sum v^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x}p_{x} {}_{}q_{x + K_x} \\
    &= \sum v^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x|}q_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

### **Whole Life Assurance**

Whole Life Assurance covers the insured **indefinitely** and thus *will* pay out whenever the insured **dies**.

Let $WL$ be the random variable denoting the PV of the death benefit:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    WL &= v^{K_x + 1} \\
    K_x &= 0, 1, \dots, \infty
\end{aligned}
$$

> Technically speaking, the upper limit of $K_x$ should $\omega-x$ as it represents the **maximum attainable age** in the discrete survival model.
>
> However, since the ${}_{k}p_{x} = 0$ for all $k \ge \omega-x$, it **does not matter** what the upper limit is as long as it is larger than $\omega-x$. Thus, in order to be concise, $\infty$ is often used instead.

Thus, the EPV is the **expectation** of the WL random variable:

$$
    A_x = \sum^\infty_{K_x = 0} v^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x|}q_{x}
$$

### **Term Assurance**

Term Assurance covers the insured for a **specified period $n$** and only pays out *if* the insured dies within that period. Nothing is paid out if the insured survives beyond that.

Let $TA$ be the random variable denoting the PV of the death benefit:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    TA &=
    \begin{cases}
        v^{K_x + 1} ,& K_x = 0, 1, \dots, n-1 \\
        0 ,& K_x \ge n
    \end{cases}
\end{aligned}
$$

<!-- Insert Diagram -->

Thus, the EPV is the **expectation** of the TA random variable:

$$
    A^{1}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} = \sum^{n-1}_{K_x = 0} v^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x|}q_{x}
$$

### **Pure Endowment**

Pure Endowments are a special kind of insurance that instead only pays out *if* the insured **survives past a certain period**. Nothing is paid out if the insured dies before that.

Let $PE$ be the random variable denoting the PV of the survival benefit:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    PE &=
    \begin{cases}
        0 ,& K_x < n \\
        v^n ,& K_x \ge n
    \end{cases}
\end{aligned}
$$

The probability of surviving past the period is given by a *single probability* ${}_{n}p_{x}$. Thus, the EPV is the **expectation** of the PE random variable:

$$
    A^{\> \> \> 1}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} = v^n \cdot {}_{n}p_{x}
$$

### **Endowment Assurance**

Endowment Assurances are a *combination* of term assurances and pure endowments:

* **Term Assurance** - Pays out if the insured dies within the period
* **Pure Endowment** - Pays out if the insured survives past the period

Similar to whole life policies, endowment assurances *will* make a payout.

Let $EA$ be the random variable denoting the PV of the benefits:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    PE &=
    \begin{cases}
        v^{K_x + 1} ,& K_x = 0, 1, \dots, n-1 \\
        v^n ,& K_x \ge n
    \end{cases}
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, the EPV is the **expectation** of the EA random variable:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    A_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}
    &= \sum^{n-1}_{K_x = 0} v^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x|}q_{x} + v^n \cdot {}_{n}p_{x} \\
    &= A^{1}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} + A^{\> \> \> 1}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}
\end{aligned}
$$
