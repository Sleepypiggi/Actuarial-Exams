# **Life Insurance Functions**

Life Insurance contracts promise to pay out a benefit *if* the insured event (Death) occurs in the *future*.

The value of a life insurance contract must reflect these two aspects:

1. Uncertainty of cashflows - **Expected Value**, based on Survival Models
2. Time value of money - **Present Value**, based on Interest Theory

Thus, the value of a life insurance contract is the **Expected Present Value** (EPV) of the promised cashflows.

There are two categories of insurance contracts, based on *when* the benefits are paid out:

<center>

| Discrete | Continuous |
| :-: | :-: |
| Paid at the **end of the period** that the insured died | Paid out at **immediately** upon the death of the insured |

</center>

## **Payable Discretely**

If the contract pays out benefits discretely, then $K_x$ is used as the survival model.

Given a benefit of $1, the PV of the benefit is $v^{K_x + 1}$.

Thus, the EPV of the contract is the **sum product** of the **PV of the benefit** in each period and the **probability of death** in that period:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    EPV
    &= \sum v^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x}p_{x} {}_{}q_{x + K_x} \\
    &= \sum v^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x|}q_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

<!-- If the SA is not 1 then the random variable is different and hence the variance -->

### **Whole Life Assurance**

**Whole Life** Assurance covers the insured **indefinitely** and thus *will* pay out whenever the insured **dies**.

Let WL be the random variable denoting the PV of the death benefit:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{WL} &= v^{K_x + 1} \\
    K_x &= 0, 1, \dots, \infty
\end{aligned}
$$

> Technically speaking, the upper limit of $K_x$ should $\omega-x$ as it represents the **maximum attainable age** in the discrete survival model.
>
> However, since the ${}_{k}p_{x} = 0$ for all $k \ge \omega-x$, it **does not matter** what the upper limit is as long as it is larger than $\omega-x$. Thus, in order to be concise, $\infty$ is often used instead.

![WL Discrete](Assets/3.%20Life%20Insurance%20Functions.md/WL%20Discrete.png){.center}

Thus, the EPV is the **Expectation/First Moment** of the WL random variable:

$$
    E(\text{WL}) = \sum^\infty_{K_x = 0} v^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x}p_{x} {}_{}q_{x + K_x}
$$

The **Second Moment** can be similarly caclulated:

$$
    E({\text{WL}}^2) = \sum^\infty_{K_x = 0} (v^{K_x + 1})^2 \cdot {}_{K_x}p_{x} {}_{}q_{x + K_x}
$$

This can be simplified to a formula *similar* to the first moment by substituting $v' = v^2$, which can be further **generalized to the k-th moment** of the random variable by substituting $v' = v^k$ instead.

The simplified second moment and thus **Variance** be calculated:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E({\text{WL}}^2)
    &= \sum^\infty_{K_x = 0} (v^2)^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x}p_{x} {}_{}q_{x + K_x} \\
    &= \sum^\infty_{K_x = 0} (v')^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x}p_{x} {}_{}q_{x + K_x} \\
    \\
    \therefore Var(\text{WL}) &= E({\text{WL}}^2) - [E(\text{WL})]^2
\end{aligned}
$$

### **Term Assurance**

**Term Assurance** covers the insured for a **specified period $n$** and only pays out *if* the insured dies within that period. Nothing is paid out if the insured survives beyond that.

Let TA be the random variable denoting the PV of the death benefit:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{TA} &=
    \begin{cases}
        v^{K_x + 1} ,& K_x = 0, 1, \dots, n-1 \\
        0 ,& K_x \ge n
    \end{cases}
\end{aligned}
$$

<!-- Self Made -->
![TA Discrete](Assets/3.%20Life%20Insurance%20Functions.md/TA%20Discrete.png)

Thus, the EPV is the **expectation** of the TA random variable:

$$
    E(\text{TA}) = \sum^{n-1}_{K_x = 0} v^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x}p_{x} {}_{}q_{x + K_x}
$$

Similarly, the simplified second moment and thus **Variance** can be calculated using the $v' = v^2$ substitution:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E({\text{TA}}^2)
    &= \sum^{n-1}_{K_x = 0} (v^2)^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x}p_{x} {}_{}q_{x + K_x} \\
    &= \sum^\infty_{K_x = 0} (v')^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x}p_{x} {}_{}q_{x + K_x} \\
    \\
    \therefore Var(\text{TA}) &= E({\text{TA}}^2) - E(\text{TA})
\end{aligned}
$$

### **Pure Endowment**

**Pure Endowments** are a special kind of insurance that instead only pays out *if* the insured **survives past a certain period**. Nothing is paid out if the insured dies before that.

Let PE be the random variable denoting the PV of the survival benefit:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{PE} &=
    \begin{cases}
        0 ,& K_x < n \\
        v^n ,& K_x \ge n
    \end{cases}
\end{aligned}
$$

<!-- Self Made -->
![PE Discrete](Assets/3.%20Life%20Insurance%20Functions.md/PE%20Discrete.png){.center}

The probability of surviving past the period is given by a *single probability* ${}_{n}p_{x}$. Thus, the EPV is the **expectation** of the PE random variable:

$$
    E(\text{PE}) = v^n {}_{n}p_{x}
$$

Add more intuition

Similarly, the simplified second moment and thus **Variance** can be calculated using the $v' = v^2$ substitution:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E({\text{PE}}^2)
    &= (v^2)^n {}_{n}p_{x} \\
    &= (v')^n {}_{n}p_{x} \\
    \\
    \therefore Var(\text{PE}) &= E({\text{PE}}^2) - E(\text{PE})
\end{aligned}
$$

### **Endowment Assurance**

**Endowment Assurances** are a *combination* of term assurances and pure endowments:

* **Term Assurance** - Pays out if the insured dies within the period
* **Pure Endowment** - Pays out if the insured survives past the period

Similar to whole life policies, endowment assurances *will* make a payout.

Let EA be the random variable denoting the PV of the benefits:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{EA}
    &= \text{TA} + \text{PE} \\
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        v^{K_x + 1} ,& K_x = 0, 1, \dots, n-1 \\
        v^n ,& K_x \ge n
    \end{cases} \\
    &= v^{min(K_x + 1, n)}
\end{aligned}
$$

<!-- Self Made -->
![EA Discrete](Assets/3.%20Life%20Insurance%20Functions.md/EA%20Discrete.png){.center}

Thus, the EPV is the **expectation** of the EA random variable:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E(\text{EA})
    &= E(\text{TA}) + E(\text{PE}) \\
    &= \sum^{n-1}_{K_x = 0} v^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x}p_{x} {}_{}q_{x + K_x} + v^n {}_{n}p_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

Note that the in the *final year* of the contract, the individual will receive $v^n$ if they die (from the TA) or receive the same $v^n$ if they survive (from the PE).

Thus, a simplification can be made to the EPV:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E(\text{EA})
    &= \sum^{n-1}_{K_x = 0} v^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x}p_{x} {}_{}q_{x + K_x} + v^n {}_{n}p_{x} \\
    &= \sum^{n-2}_{K_x = 0} v^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x}p_{x} {}_{}q_{x + K_x} + v^n {}_{n-1}p_{x} {}_{}q_{x + n - 1} + v^n {}_{n}p_{x} \\
    &= \sum^{n-2}_{K_x = 0} v^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x}p_{x} {}_{}q_{x + K_x} + v^n ({}_{n-1}p_{x} {}_{}q_{x + n - 1} + {}_{n}p_{x}) \\
    &= \sum^{n-2}_{K_x = 0} v^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x}p_{x} {}_{}q_{x + K_x} + v^n {}_{n-1}p_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

### **Deferred Assurances**

Deferred Assurances are variations of the above contracts where the **coverage is deferred by $n$ years**. While any contract can be deferred, the most useful is the **Deferred Whole Life Assurance**.

Let DWL be the random variable denoting the PV of the benefits of a deferred whole life assurance:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{DWL}
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        0, K_x = 0 ,& 1, 2, \dots, n-1 \\
        v^{K_x + 1} ,& K_x \ge n
    \end{cases}
\end{aligned}
$$

<!-- Self Made -->
![DWL Discrete](Assets/3.%20Life%20Insurance%20Functions.md/DWL%20Discrete.png){.center}

Thus, the EPV is the **expectation** of the DWL random variable:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E(\text{DWL})
    &= \sum^{\infty}_{K_x = n} v^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x}p_{x} {}_{}q_{x + K_x} \\
    &= \sum^{\infty}_{K_x = 0} v^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x}p_{x} {}_{}q_{x + K_x} - \sum^{n-1}_{K_x = 0} v^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x}p_{x} {}_{}q_{x + K_x} \\
    &= E(WL) - E(TA)
\end{aligned}
$$

Intuitively, a DWL can be thought of as an WL that is **issued $n$ years later**. Thus, the EPV of this WL policy can be brought forward time by **adjusting for both interest and survival**:

$$
    E(\text{DWL}) = v^n {}_{n}p_{x} * E(WL_{x+n})
$$

This allows a TA to be expressed as the **difference of two WL policies issued at different times**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E(\text{DWL}) &= v^n {}_{n}p_{x} * E(WL_{x+n}) \\
    E(WL) - E(TA) &= v^n {}_{n}p_{x} * E(WL_{x+n}) \\
    E(TA) &= E(WL) - v^n {}_{n}p_{x} * E(WL_{x+n})
\end{aligned}
$$

### **Actuarial Notation**

Similar to the survival model, given how often these values are calculated, they are abbreviated using the **International Actuarial Notation** as well.

${}^{k}A$ represents the **k-th moment** of a contract where a benefit of 1 is paid discretely when the **status fails** (Life Insurance). $k$ is the multiplier on the interest rate for that moment.

> As before, if $k=1$, it is omitted; EG. ${}^{1}A = A$.
>
> This notation will mainly be used for the first and second moments for the EPV and variance respectively.

The subscript $x$ is the age of the policyholder, known as the **Life Status**. The life status fails when the policyholder dies. The additional subscript $\enclose{actuarial}{n}$ represents the **duration of the policy**, known as the **Duration Status**. It fails if the policyholder *survives* past the policyterm.

A 1 above the status indicates that the policy pays **only** pays if that particular status **fails first**. If no "1" is included, then the policy pays whichever status fails first.

> If the duration status is omitted, then the policy is assumed to last forever.

Thus putting everything together, the EPV of each policy can be denoted as follows:

* **Whole Life Assurance** - Payable whenever policyholder dies; $A_x$
* **Term Assurance** - Payable only if policyholder dies during policy period; $A^{1}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}$
* **Pure Endowment** - Payable only if policyholder survives past policy period; $A^{\>\>\>\> 1}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}$
* **Endowment Assurance** - Payable whichever of the above two occur first; $A_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}$

### **Recursions**

The EPV of each contract can also be expressed through **backwards recursion**, where it is calculated as a function of itself.

Consider the **WL** random variable:

* If the policyholder dies in the year with probability ${}_{}q_{x}$, then a benefit of 1 is paid at the end of the year.
* If the policyholder survives past the year with probability ${}_{}p_{x}$, then the policyholder will die in some future year. The PV of the benefit at the end of the year is given is the **EPV of the same contract but at that future time**; $A_{x+1}$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    WL
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        v \cdot 1 ,& {}_{}q_{x} \\
        v \cdot A_{x+1} ,& {}_{}p_{x}
    \end{cases}
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\therefore A_x = v{}_{}q_{x} + v{}_{}p_{x}A_{x+1}
$$

<!-- Self Made -->
![WL Recursion](Assets/3.%20Life%20Insurance%20Functions.md/WL%20Recursion.png)

Consider the same exercise for the **TA** random variable:

The main difference is that the EPV of the same contract at a future time is denoted by $A^1_{x+1:\enclose{actuarial}{n-1}}$, where the $n-1$ reflects that the **policyholder survived the first year** of the policy, thus only $n-1$ years of coverage remain.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    TA
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        v \cdot 1 ,& {}_{}q_{x} \\
        v \cdot A^1_{x+1:\enclose{actuarial}{n-1}} ,& {}_{}p_{x}
    \end{cases}
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
    \therefore A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n-1}} = v{}_{}q_{x} + v{}_{}p_{x}A^1_{x+1:\enclose{actuarial}{n-1}}
$$

Consider the same exercise for the **PE** random variable:

The main difference is that if the policyholder dies in the current year, **no benefit** will be paid out at the end of the year. Thus, there only the second component remains.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    PE
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        0 ,& {}_{}q_{x} \\
        v \cdot A^{\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\> 1}_{x+1:\enclose{actuarial}{n-1}} ,& {}_{}p_{x}
    \end{cases}
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
    \therefore A^{\>\>\> 1}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} = v{}_{}p_{x}A^{\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\> 1}_{x+1:\enclose{actuarial}{n-1}}
$$

> EA is omitted as it is simply the combination of a TA and PE.

These identities are only useful in situations where a **starting point** for the EPVs are provided. If they are not provided, the **final year** of the policy can be used as a starting point:

* Since the policyholder will **inevitably die**, the benefit of 1 for WL and TA will **always be paid out**. Thus, their EPV is always $v$.
* From another perspective, the benefit of 1 for a PE will **never be paid out**. Thus, their EPV is always $0$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E(\text{WL}_{\omega-1}) &= v \\
    E(\text{TA}_{\omega-1}) &= v \\
    E(\text{PE}_{\omega-1}) &= 0 \\
    \therefore E(\text{EA}_{\omega-1}) &= v
\end{aligned}
$$

> While not very useful in a written setting, they are particularly useful in a **spreadsheets** where the calculations can be easily recursed.

### **Key Intuitions**

When performing EPV calculations, some intuitions (sense checks) can be used to determine if they are in the right direction.

#### **Comparing the same policy**

When comparing the EPV of the two policies of the **same type but at different ages**, the EPV of the policy with the higher probability of making a claim is higher:

* For death policies, the EPV of a policy issued at an **older age is higher** due to the higher probability of death
* For survival policies, the EPV of a policy issued at a **younger age is higher** due to the higher probability of survival

<!-- To check again on EPV of EA -->

When comparing two policies of the **same type but different interest rates**, the EPV of the policy with the lower the interest rate, the lower the EPV of the policy. This is because the PV of the benefits at every time point is smaller than before.

#### **Comparing different policies**

At an arbitrarily young age, the probability of death is low. Thus, the EPVs in ascending order:

1. TA - Unlikely to die during policy term; high chance of receiving nothing
2. WL - Unlikely to die in the short term; high chance of receiving benefit in the future (heavily discounted)
3. PE - Likely to survive till the end of the policy term; high chance of receiving benefit
4. EA - Combination of PE and TA

<!-- Term approaches WL, EA Approaches TA -->

At an arbitrarily old age, the probabilty of death is high. Thus, the EPVs in ascending order:

1. PE - Likely to die during the policy term; high chance of receiving nothing
2. TA - Likely to die during the policy term; high chance of receiving benefit soon
3. EA - PE component is small; marginally higher than term
4. WL - DTA component is high; significantly higher than term

<!-- To check the above -->

## **Payable Continuously**

In practice, benefits are usually paid out **shortly after** verification of the insured event. This means that the benefit of the contract can be paid **any time** throughout the year (Continuous).

$T_x$ is used as the survival model to reflect the continuous nature of the benefits.

Given a benefit of $1, the PV of the benefit is $v^{T_x}$.

Thus, the EPV of the contract is the **definite integral** of the product of the PV and PDF, which is essentially the sum product of the PV of the benefits and probability of death for every infinitely small unit of time.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{EPV} = \int^\infty_0 v^{T_x} {}_{T_x}p_{x} \mu_{x+T_x}
\end{aligned}
$$

### **Continuous Whole Life**

### **Continuous Term**

### **Continuous Endowment**

No such thing as continuous PE

## **Discrete Continuous Approximations**

Continuous coint

Contracts that have benefits payable continuously have a higher EPV than those payable discretely as the cashflows happen sooner; discounted lesser.

$$
    \bar{A} > A
$$

However, an adjustment can be made to the EPV of the discrete contract to account for this under-discounting such that the EPV of the two types of contracts are **approximately equal** (under several assumptions).

### **Uniform Death Distribution**

It can be assumed that $T_x$ is **uniformly distributed** within a year, with each year having a different constant. This is known as the **Uniform Death Distribution** (UDD):

$$
\begin{aligned}
    f_{x+k}(1)
    &= {}_{t}p_{x+k} \mu_{x+k+t} \\
    &\approx {}_{}q_{x+k} \\
    &\approx c
\end{aligned}
$$

A WL contract can be thought of as a series of year deferred TAs with one year of coverage:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \bar{A}_x
    &= {}_{0|}\bar{A}^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{1}} + {}_{1|}\bar{A}^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{1}} + {}_{1|}\bar{A}^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{2}} + ... \\
    &= \bar{A}^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{1}} + v^1 {}_{1}p_{x} \bar{A}^1_{x+1:\enclose{actuarial}{1}} + v^2 {}_{2}p_{x} \bar{A}^1_{x+2:\enclose{actuarial}{2}} + ... \\
    &= \sum^k_{k=0} v^k {}_{k}p_{x} \bar{A}^1_{x+k:\enclose{actuarial}{1}}
\end{aligned}
$$

Under UDD, each deferred TA can be simplified to the following:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \bar{A}^1_{x+k:\enclose{actuarial}{1}}
    &= \int^1_0 v^t {}_{t}p_{x+k} \mu_{x+k+t} \\
    &= \int^1_0 v^t q_{x+k} \\
    &= q_{x+k} \int^1_0 e^{-\delta t} \\
    &= q_{x+k} \left[\frac{e^{-\delta t}}{-\delta t}\right]^1_0 \\
    &= q_{x+k} \frac{1-e^{-\delta}}{-\delta} \\
    &= q_{x+k} \frac{iv}{\delta}
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, the EPV of a continuous contract can be shown to be a function of a discrete one:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \bar{A}_x
    &= \sum^k_{k=0} v^k {}_{k}p_{x} \bar{A}^1_{x+k:\enclose{actuarial}{1}} \\
    &= \sum^k_{k=0} v^k q_{x+k} \frac{iv}{\delta} \\
    &= q_{x} \frac{iv}{\delta} + v^{1} {}_{1}p_{x} q_{x+1} \frac{iv}{\delta} + v^{2} {}_{2}p_{x} q_{x+2} \frac{iv}{\delta} ... \\
    &= \frac{i}{\delta} (vq_{x} + v^{2} {}_{1}p_{x}q_{x+1} + v^{3} {}_{2}p_{x}q_{x+2} + ...) \\
    &= \frac{i}{\delta} A_x
\end{aligned}
$$

> Depsite the proof using a WL contract, it applies for all continuous contracts as well.
>
> Note that for EAs, only the TA needs to be approximated to continuous form. Recall that there are no continuous PEs.

### **Claims Acceleration**

Following the UDD assumption, death is **equally likely to occur in any segment** of the year. Thus, on average, the death occurs at roughly $x+k+\frac{1}{2}$.

For a continuous contract under this assumption, the benefits are paid out on average in the middle of the year and are thus discounted using multiples of $v^{\frac{1}{2}}$ instead.

<!-- Self Made -->

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \bar{A}_x
    &\approx v^{\frac{1}{2}} q_x + v^{\frac{3}{2}} p_x {}_{}q_{x+1} + v^{\frac{5}{2}} {}_{2}p_{x} {}_{}q_{x+2} + \dots \\
    &\approx (1+i)^{\frac{1}{2}} (vq_x + v^1 p_x {}_{}q_{x+1} + v^2 {}_{2}p_{x} {}_{}q_{x+2} + \dots) \\
    &\approx (1+i)^{\frac{1}{2}} A_x
\end{aligned}
$$

> Similar to before, the proof applies to all continuous contracts.

This method is known as the **Claims Acceleration Approach** as the benefits payable in the middle of the year are simply discrete benefits that are accelerated, accounting for the "over-discounting".
