# **Life Annuity Functions**

Life Annuity contracts promise to pay out a **stream of benefits** in the future for *as long* the policyholder remains alive.

Similar to before, life annuity benefits can be paid discretely or continuously and can be valued through their EPV.

## **Payable Discretely**

If the contract pays out benefits discretely, then $K_x$ is used as the survival model.

Since an annuity pays a stream of benefits as opposed to a lumpsum, the PV of a life annuity is the **sum of the PVs of all the payments** made *up till* that point.

Recall that there are two main types of payment structures:

<center>

| Period Start | Period End |
| :-: | :-: |
| Paid in Advance | Paid in Arrears |
| Annuity Due | Annuity Immediate |
| $\begin{aligned} PV &= 0 + v + v^2 + ... + v^{K_x} \\ &= a_{\enclose{actuarial}{K_x}} \end{aligned}$ | $\begin{aligned} PV &= 1 + v + v^2 + ... + v^{K_x+1} \\ &= \ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{K_x}} \end{aligned}$ |

</center>

Thus, the EPV of the contract is the **sum product** of the **PV of the benefit** in each period and the **probability of death** in that period:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{EPV} &= \sum a_{\enclose{actuarial}{K_x}} \cdot {}_{K_x}p_{x} {}_{}q_{x + K_x} \\
    \\
    \ddot{\text{EPV}} &= \sum \ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{K_x}} \cdot {}_{K_x}p_{x} {}_{}q_{x + K_x}
\end{aligned}
$$
