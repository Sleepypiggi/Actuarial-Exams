# **Life Assurances**

## **Overview**

Life Assurances are contracts that promise to pay out a benefit *if* the insured event occurs in the *future*.

The value of a life assurance must reflect these two aspects:

1. Uncertainty of cashflows - **Expected Value**, based on Survival Models
2. Time value of money - **Present Value**, based on Interest Theory

Thus, the value of a life assurance is the **Expected Present Value** (EPV) of the promised cashflows.

## **Payable Discretely**

The simplest form of life assurance pays the benefits at the **end of the year** that the insured event occurs.

For an assurance payable discretely, **$K_x$ is used as the survival model**. Thus, the **present value** of the benefit payable in each period is $v^{K_x + 1}$.

The EPV is the **Triple Product Summation** of the various components:

1. **Amount** of benefit, $B$
2. **Discounting** of the benefit, $v^{K_x + 1}$
3. **Probability** of paying the benefit, ${}_{K_x}p_{x} {}_{}q_{x + K_x}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
    EPV
    &= \sum B \cdot v^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x}p_{x} {}_{}q_{x + K_x} \\
    &= \sum B \cdot v^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x|}q_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

For simplicity, all of the proofs in this section will use $B=1$. This also has the benefit of allowing the EPVs to be *easily scaled* for any level of $B$.

### **Actuarial Notation**

Similar to the survival model, given how often these values are calculated, they are abbreviated using the **International Actuarial Notation** as well.

$A$ represents the **first moment** (expectation) of the **present value** of a contract where a **benefit of 1** is payable discretely when the *status fails*.

The subscript $x$ is the age of the policyholder, known as the **Life Status**. It fails when the policyholder *dies*.

An additional subscript $:\enclose{actuarial}{n}$ is the duration that the assurance remains valid, known as the **Duration Status**. It fails if the policyholder *survives* past the policyterm.

A $1$ above the status indicates that the assurance pays **only** pays if that **particular status fails first**. If nothing is indicated, then the assurance pays whichever status fails first.

!!! Note

    If a particular status is omitted, then the assurance is **not dependent on that status**. For instance, omitting the duration status means that the contract is only dependent on the age of the policyholder.

An assurance that **begins $n$ years later** is known as a **Deferred Assurance**, which is denoted by ${}_{n|}A$, following the same notation as deferred probabilities.

Thus, putting everything together, the EPV of each assurance can be denoted as follows:

* **Whole Life Assurance** - Payable whenever policyholder dies; $A_x$
* **Term Assurance** - Payable only if policyholder dies during assurance period; $A^{1}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}$
* **Pure Endowment** - Payable only if policyholder survives past assurance period; $A^{\>\>\> 1}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}$
* **Endowment Assurance** - Payable whichever of the above two occur first; $A_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}$
* **Deferred Whole Life Assurance** - Payable only if policyholder dies after $n$ years; ${}_{n|}A_x$

!!! Tip

    **Pure Endowments** can also be expressed as ${}_{n}E_x$ for easier typesetting and is the method that SOA usually uses to denote PEs.

### **Whole Life Assurance**

**Whole Life Assurances** cover the insured **indefinitely** and thus *will* pay out *whenever* the insured dies.

Let WL be the **random variable** denoting the PV of the death benefit:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{WL} &= v^{K_x + 1}, \ K_x = 0, 1, \dots, \infty
\end{aligned}
$$

<!-- Self Made -->
![WL Discrete](Assets/3.%20Life%20Assurances.md/WL%20Discrete.png){.center}

The EPV is the **First Moment** of the WL random variable:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E(\text{WL}) &= \sum^\infty_{k = 0} v^{k + 1} \cdot {}_{k|}q_{x} \\
    A_{x} &= \sum^\infty_{k = 0} v^{k + 1} \cdot {}_{k|}q_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

Another commonly used metric is the **Variance** of the contract. In order to get it, the **Second Moment** must first be determined:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E({\text{WL}}^2)
    &= \sum^\infty_{k = 0} \left(v^{k + 1}\right)^2 \cdot {}_{k|}q_{x} \\
    &= \sum^\infty_{k = 0} \left[(v^2)^{k + 1} \right] \cdot {}_{k|}q_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

Notice that the expression can be simplified to a form that looks **almost identical to the first moment** - with the only difference being that is uses $v^2$ instead of $v$.

Thus, the second moment is simply the first moment **evaluated at a higher interest rate** $i^*=(1+i)^2-1$, such that $v^* = v^2$.

!!! Tip

    Using **actuarial notation**, the k-th moment is thus denoted as ${}^{k}A_x$, where $k$ is the **multiplier on the interest rate** used to evaluate the moment, $i^*=(1+i)^k-1$.
    
    It can also be more **generally denoted** as $\left. A_x \right|_{i = (1+i)^2-1}$, which will come in handy for more complicated expressions.

The **Second Moment** and hence **Variance** can be shown as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E({\text{WL}}^2) &= \sum^\infty_{K_x = 0} (v^2)^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x|}q_{x} \\
    {}^{2} A_{x} &= \sum^\infty_{K_x = 0} (v^*)^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x|}q_{x} \\
    \\
    \therefore Var(\text{WL}) &= {}^{2} A_{x} - (A_{x})^2
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Warning

    Recall that we assumed that the benefit is 1 for simplicity when deriving the formulas. This will **NOT be the final EPV/Variance**.

    In practice, we have to **scale the EPV/Variance** accordingly based on the actual benefit. This may lead to an extremely large value for the variance, thus do not be alarmed when performing such calculations.

### **Term Assurance**

**Term Assurance** covers the insured for a **specified period $n$** and only pays out *if* the insured dies within that period. **NOTHING** is paid out if the insured *survives beyond* that.

Let TA be the random variable denoting the PV of the death benefit:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{TA} &=
    \begin{cases}
        v^{K_x + 1} ,& K_x = 0, 1, \dots, n-1 \\
        0 ,& K_x \ge n
    \end{cases} \\
    &= {}_{\{K_x \le n-1\}} v^{K_x+1}
\end{aligned}
$$

$\{K_x \le n-1\}$ is known as an **Indicator Function**, which is a binary variable that takes **1 if the condition is true and 0 if the condition if false**. It provides a concise way to express a piecewise function in a single expression.

<!-- Self Made -->
![TA Discrete](Assets/3.%20Life%20Assurances.md/TA%20Discrete.png)

Thus, the EPV and Variance can be determined:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E(\text{TA}) &= \sum^{n-1}_{k = 0} v^{k + 1} \cdot {}_{k|}q_{x} + 0 \cdot {}_{n}p_{x} \\
    A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} &= \sum^{n-1}_{k = 0} v^{k + 1} \cdot {}_{k|}q_{x} \\
    \\
    E({\text{TA}}^2) &= \sum^{n-1}_{k = 0} (v^2)^{k + 1} \cdot {}_{k|}q_{x} + 0^2 \cdot {}_{n}p_{x} \\
    {}^{2} A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} &= \sum^\infty_{k = 0} (v^2)^{k + 1} \cdot {}_{k|}q_{x} \\
    \\
    \therefore Var(\text{TA}) &= {}^{2} A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} - (A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}})^2
\end{aligned}
$$

### **Pure Endowment**

**Pure Endowments** are a special kind of contract that instead only pays out *if* the insured **survives** past a specified period $n$. **NOTHING** is paid out if the insured *dies before* that.

Let PE be the **random variable** denoting the PV of the survival benefit:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{PE} &=
    \begin{cases}
        0 ,& K_x = 0, 1, 2 \dots, n \\
        v^n ,& K_x \ge n
    \end{cases}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Note

    Unlike the other assurances, the discounting factor for PE **does NOT depend on $K_x$** because it is **paid out at a fixed time at maturity**. No matter how long the policyholder survives past maturity, they are ONLY going to receive that amount.

<!-- Self Made -->
![PE Discrete](Assets/3.%20Life%20Assurances.md/PE%20Discrete.png){.center}

Thus, the EPV and Variance can be determined:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E(\text{PE}) &= 0 \cdot {}_{n}q_{x} + v^n {}_{n}p_{x} \\
    {}_{n}E_x &= v^n {}_{n}p_{x} \\
    \\
    E({\text{PE}}^2) &= 0^2 \cdot {}_{n}q_{x} + (v^2)^n {}_{n}p_{x} \\
    {}^{2}_{n}E_x &= (v^*)^n {}_{n}p_{x} \\
    \\
    \therefore Var(\text{PE}) &= {}^{2}_{n}E_x - ({}_{n}E_x)^2
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Note

    Note that unlike all other assurances, a summation was not involved, since the values do not depend on $K_x$.

    The probability of receiving the payout is simply the *single probability* of surviving till maturity, since it does not matter what happens after that.

### **Endowment Assurance**

**Endowment Assurances** are a *combination* of term assurances and pure endowments:

* **Term Assurance** - Pays out if the insured dies within the period
* **Pure Endowment** - Pays out if the insured survives past the period
* Thus, endowment assurances WILL pay out no matter what

Let EA be the random variable denoting the PV of the benefits:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{EA}
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        v^{K_x + 1} ,& K_x = 0, 1, \dots, n-1 \\
        v^n ,& K_x \ge n
    \end{cases} \\
    &= v^{\min(K_x + 1, n)}
\end{aligned}
$$

<!-- Self Made -->
![EA Discrete](Assets/3.%20Life%20Assurances.md/EA%20Discrete.png){.center}

Thus, the EPV and Variance can be determined:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E(\text{EA}) &= \sum^{n-1}_{k = 0} v^{k + 1} \cdot {}_{k|}q_{x} + v^n {}_{n}p_{x} \\
    A_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} &= A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} + {}_{n}E_{x} \\
    \\
    E(\text{EA}^2) &= \sum^{n-1}_{k = 0} (v^2)^{k + 1} \cdot {}_{k|}q_{x} + (v^2)^n {}_{n}p_{x} \\
    {}^{2} A_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}
    &= \sum^{n-1}_{k = 0} (v^*)^{k + 1} \cdot {}_{k|}q_{x} + (v^*)^n {}_{n}p_{x} \\
    &= {}^{2} A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} + {}^{2}_{n}E_x \\
    \\
    \therefore Var(\text{EA})
    &= {}^{2} A_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} - \left(A_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}\right)^2 \\
    &= \left({}^{2} A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} + {}^{2}_{n}E_x \right) - \left(A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} - ({}_{n}E_x) \right)^2 \\
    &= \left({}^{2} A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} + {}^{2}_{n}E_x \right) - \left[(A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}})^2 + 2(A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} \cdot {}_{n}E_x) + ({}_{n}E_x)^2 \right]
\end{aligned}
$$

Note that the in the *final year* of the contract, the assurance **will pay $v^n$ regardless** of the outcome - TA pays if they die while PE pays if they survive. Thus, a simplification can be made to the EPV:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    A_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}
    &= \sum^{n-1}_{k = 0} v^{k + 1} \cdot {}_{k|}q_{x} + v^n {}_{n}p_{x} \\
    &= \sum^{n-2}_{k = 0} v^{k + 1} \cdot {}_{k}p_{x} {}_{}q_{x + k} + v^n {}_{n-1}p_{x} {}_{}q_{x + n - 1} + v^n {}_{n}p_{x} \\
    &= \sum^{n-2}_{k = 0} v^{k + 1} \cdot {}_{k|}q_{x} + v^n ({}_{n-1}p_{x} {}_{}q_{x + n - 1} + {}_{n}p_{x}) \\
    &= \sum^{n-2}_{k = 0} v^{k + 1} \cdot {}_{k|}q_{x} + v^n {}_{n-1}p_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Tip

    This formula might *seem redundant* because it is not that much simpler than the original, as it only requires **one less probability**:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        A_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{3}}
        &= v \cdot q_{x} + v^2 \cdot p_{x}q_{x+1} + v^3 \cdot p_{x}p_{x+1}q_{x+2} + v^3 + {}_{3}p_{x} \\
        &= v \cdot q_{x} + v^2 \cdot p_{x}q_{x+1} + v^3 \cdot {}_{2}p_{x} \\
        &= v \cdot q_{x} + v^2 \cdot p_{x}q_{x+1} + v^3 \cdot p_{x} \cdot p_{x+1} \\
        &= v \cdot q_{x} + v^2 \cdot p_{x}q_{x+1} + v^3 \cdot p_{x} \cdot (1 - q_{x+1})
    \end{aligned}
    $$

    However, this is extremely useful when limited information is provided, allowing us to still be able to calculate the EPV.

### **Deferred Assurances**

Deferred Assurances are variations of any of the above assurances, where the assurance **starts $n$ years later rather** than immediately. While any assurance can be deferred, the most common is the **Deferred Whole Life**.

#### **Deferred WL**

Let DWL be the random variable denoting the PV of the benefits of a deferred whole life assurance:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{DWL}
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        0,& K_x = 0, 1, 2, \dots, n-1 \\
        v^{K_x + 1} ,& K_x \ge n
    \end{cases} \\
    &= {}_{\{K_x \ge n\}} v^{K_x + 1}
\end{aligned}
$$

<!-- Self Made -->
![DWL Discrete](Assets/3.%20Life%20Assurances.md/DWL%20Discrete.png)

Thus, the EPV and Variance can be determined:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E(\text{DWL}) &= 0 \cdot {}_{n}p_{x} + \sum^{\infty}_{K_x = n} v^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x|}q_{x} \\
    {}_{n|} A_{x}
    &= \sum^{\infty}_{K_x = 0} v^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x|}q_{x} - \sum^{n-1}_{K_x = 0} v^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x|}q_{x} \\
    &= A_x - A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} \\
    \\
    Var (\text{DWL})
    &= {}^{2}_{n|}A_x - ({}_{n|}A_x)^2 \\
    &= \left({}^{2}A_x - {}^{2}A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}\right) - \left(A_x - A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}\right)^2
\end{aligned}
$$

Alternatively, since a DWL is simply a WL assurance issued $n$ years later, the EPV of the DWL is equivalent to the EPV of a WL issued at age $x+n$ after **adjusting for interest and survival**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{n|} A_{x}
    &= \sum^{\infty}_{K_x = n} v^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x|}q_{x} \\
    &= \sum^{\infty}_{K_x = n} v^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x}p_{x} \cdot q_{x+K_x} \\
    &= \sum^{\infty}_{K_x = 0} v^{K_x + 1 + n} \cdot {}_{K_x+n}p_{x} \cdot q_{x+K_x+n} \\
    &= \sum^{\infty}_{K_x = 0} v^{K_x + 1} v^{n} \cdot {}_{n}p_{x} {}_{K_x}p_{x+n} \cdot q_{x+K_x+n} \\
    &= v^n {}_{n} p_{x} \sum^{\infty}_{K_x = 0} v^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x|}q_{x+n} \\
    &= {}_{n}E_{x} \cdot A_{x+n} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Note

    Recall in the previous section that we had to **account for the person surviving** till a certain age. However, now the amount must **also be discounted** to its present value.

    PEs can thus be used as a factor that **both discounts and accounts for mortality**. Most common values for PE can be found in the life table.

This allows a TA to be expressed as the **difference of two WL assurances issued at different times**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{n|} A_{x} &= {}_{n}E_{x} * A_{x+n} \\
    A_x - A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} &= {}_{n}E_{x} * A_{x+n} \\
    A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} &= A_{x} - {}_{n}E_{x} * A_{x+n} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Tip

    This result is **extremely important** as this is the main method of calculating the EPV of a TA as the values for the WL can be easily found in the SULT.

    Note that this result **also applies to the second moment**, allowing us to easily compute the variance of a TA:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        {}^{2} A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}
        &= {}^{2} A_{x} - {}^{2}_{n} E_{x} \cdot {}^{2} A_{x+n}
    \end{aligned}
    $$

    The key intuition is understanding that the **discounting factor should be squared**, which is why ${}^{2}_{n} E_{x}$ is also used.

However, if the interest is not 0.05 or if mortality does NOT follow the SULT, then the EPV of a TA must be calculated manually. If so, there is usually a catch that allows the EPV to be easily calculated:

* **Different Interest**: Term of the contract is short (EG. 3 Years)
* **Different Mortality**: Mortality can be simplified (EG. Becomes a constant)
* It is rare to have problems that have both different interest and mortality. In such cases, it is likely that an *adjusted* mortality table is provided.

![DWL Difference](Assets/3.%20Life%20Assurances.md/DWL%20Difference.png){.center}

#### **Deferred TA**

Another less commonly used deferred assurance is the **Deferred Term Assurance**. As both a **deferred and term** assurance, both results apply to it:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{k|}A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}
    &= {}_{k}E_{x} \cdot A^1_{x+k:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} \\
    &= {}_{k}E_{x} \cdot (A_{x+k} - {}_{n}E_{x} \cdot A_{x+k+n})
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Warning

    It is an extremely common mistake to use the same PE inside and outside.

    Note that the inner PE is for the duration of the policy while the outer PE is for the duration of the deferment.

Alternatively, it can be used as a building block to decompose a regular assurance. An $n$ year term assurance can be thought of as the **sum of $n$ deferred TAs**, each with a one year term:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} &= \sum^{n-1}_{k=0} {}_{k|}A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{1}} \\
    A_{x} &= \sum^{\infty}_{k=0} {}_{k|}A_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

> Since WLs are just term assurances with infinite coverage, it can be extended to WLs as well if needed.
>
> This result will come in handy in later sections.

### **Recursions**

The EPV of each contract can also be expressed through **backwards recursion**, where it is calculated as a function of itself one year later.

Consider the **WL** random variable:

* If the policyholder **dies** in the year, a **benefit of 1** is paid at the **end of the year**.
* If the policyholder **survives** the year, they "receive" the **PV of the future benefits** at the **end of the year**.
* Since both amounts are at the end of the year, they must be **discounted to the start** of the year.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    WL
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        v \cdot 1 ,& {}_{}q_{x} \\
        v \cdot A_{x+1} ,& {}_{}p_{x}
    \end{cases} \\
    \\
    \therefore A_x &= v \cdot {}_{}q_{x} + v \cdot {}_{}p_{x}A_{x+1}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Tip

    The same recursion can be **applied to the second moment** as well, since it is simply the first moment evaluated at a higher interest.

    The only change is that the discounting factor used must be calculated using the **higher interest**.

The same exercise can be shown for the **TA** random variable. The main difference is understanding how the age & duration changes:

* $x+1$ reflects the new age of the policyholder (same as WL)
* $n-1$ reflects that **one year of coverage has passed** (not applicable for WL)

$$
\begin{aligned}
    TA
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        v \cdot 1 ,& {}_{}q_{x} \\
        v \cdot A^1_{x+1:\enclose{actuarial}{n-1}} ,& {}_{}p_{x}
    \end{cases} \\
    \\
    \therefore A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}
    &= v{}_{}q_{x} + v \cdot {}_{}p_{x} A^1_{x+1:\enclose{actuarial}{n-1}}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Note

    Note that since it requires a term policy with a *reduced term*, this recursion is not particularly useful as it is difficult to obtain it.

The **PE** variable is similar, with the main difference being that the policyholder will **receive nothing if the policyholder dies**. Thus, only the second component of the recursion remains:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    PE
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        0 ,& {}_{}q_{x} \\
        v \cdot {}_{n-1}E_{x+1} ,& {}_{}p_{x}
    \end{cases} \\
    \\
    \therefore {}_{n}E_{x} &= v \cdot {}_{}p_{x} \cdot {}_{n-1}E_{x+1}
\end{aligned}
$$

EA recursions are omitted from this section as it is simply the combination of a TA and PE.

#### **Fractional Ages**

Recursion can also be used to calculate the **EPV of an assurance at a fractional age**.

The process is similar as before, but with **fractional age probabilities** instead:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    WL
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        v \cdot 1 ,& {}_{s}q_{x} \\
        v \cdot A_{x+s} ,& {}_{s}p_{x}
    \end{cases} \\
    \\
    \therefore A_x &= v \cdot {}_{s}q_{x} + v^s \cdot {}_{s}p_{x} A_{x+s}
\end{aligned}
$$

By re-arranging the equation, we can **solve for the fractional age EPV**. The fractional age probabilities can be calculated using the specified assumption.

### **Probabilities and Percentiles**

Apart from just calculating the Expectation and Variance, the **probabilities** and hence **percentiles** of the contract benefits can be calculated as well.

The **former** refers to calculating the **probability that the RV is at most some value** $u$. In other words, that the PV (**NOT the EPV!**) is at most $u$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{WL} &\le u \\
    v^{K_x+1} &\le u \\
    (K_x+1) &\ln v \le \ln u \\
    K_x+1 &\ge \frac{\ln u}{\ln v} \\
    K_x & \ge \frac{\ln u}{\ln v} - 1 \\
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Warning

    It is a **common mistake** to forget to flip the inequality sign as $\ln v \lt 0$.

The RHS of the expression is unlikely to be an integer. However, $K_x$ can only take integer values. Thus, the values are **rounded up** to the nearest whole number (EG. 5):

$$
\begin{aligned}
    P(K_x \ge \frac{\ln u}{\ln v} - 1)
    &= P(K_x \ge 5) \\
    &= P(T_x \ge 5) \\
    &= {}_{5}p_x
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Note

    Questions will not be as straightforward as above. Most of the time, the required value of $K_x$ has to be determined intuitively from the scenario given.

    For instance, assume that the premium is 1 and the benefit is 10. A question may ask for the probability that the total collected premiums exceeds the undiscounted benefit.

    Since premiums are only received when the policyholder is alive, the insurer must collect **at least 10 rounds of premium** to "break even". In other words, the question is asking for the **probability that $K_x \gt 10$**.

The **latter** refers to calculating the **percentile of the random variable**, which is the smallest value of the RV that results in the specified probability.

This process is the opposite of the previous one - it involves solving for $T_x$, converting it to $K_x$ and then subsituting it back into the RV, which results in the **associated percentile**.

## **Payable Continuously**

In practice, life assurances pay benefits **as soon as the insured event occurs**, thus is akin to paying out **continuously** throughout the year.

Notice that paying out continuously is actually a **special case** of a contract that pays out **$m$ times a year**, where $m$ tends to infinity.

* $m=1$; Paid at the end of the year
* $m=4$; Paid at the end of the quarter
* $m=12$; Paid at the end of the month
* $m=\infty$; Paid at the time of death (Instant)

Thus, despite the header stating "payable continously", this section will instead cover **paying out $m$ times a year**, which can be used to derive the continuous case.

!!! Warning

    Many of the concepts introduced earlier also apply to the "continuous" case.

    However, one key difference lies in the recursion. Since the **benefits are not paid out at the end of the year**, the the **extent that the benefit has to be discounted changes**.

    If benefits are only paid out at the end of the year:
    
    $$
        A_x = v \cdot {}_{0.5}q_{x} + v^{0.5} \cdot {}_{0.5}p_{x} A_{x+0.5}
    $$

    If benefits are paid out every half a year:

    $$
        A^{(2)}_{x} = v^{0.5} \cdot {}_{0.5}q_{x} + v^{0.5} \cdot {}_{0.5}p_{x} A_{x+0.5}
    $$

The RV must now reflect the **probability of death at fractional ages**. Intuitively, it can be thought of as the probability *living till a discrete age* and then dying within a sub-period within that year:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    K_x + \frac{j+1}{m}, \ j = 0, 1, 2, ..., m-1
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, the corresponding random variable representing the PV of the benefits:

$$
    \text{PV} = v^{K_x + \frac{j+1}{m}}
$$

![Continuous RV](Assets/3.%20Life%20Assurances.md/Continuous%20RV.png){.center}

The EPV of an assurance payable $m$ times a year can be denoted with the **$(m)$ superscript** with the same notations as before:

$$
    A^{(m)}_{x}
    = \sum^{\infty}_{K_x=0} v^{K_x} {}_{K_x}p_x  
    \cdot \sum^{m-1}_{j=0} v^{\frac{j+1}{m}} {}_{\frac{j}{m}}p_{x+K_x}
    \cdot {}_{\frac{1}{m}} q_{x+K_x+\frac{j}{m}} \\
$$

!!! Warning

    Note that the benefit used is still the **ANNUAL BENEFIT**. To obtain the actual benefit payable **per period**, then it should be divided by the number of periods:

    $$
        \text{Per Period Benefit} = \frac{B}{m}
    $$

Unfortunately, most life tables do not naturally provide probabilities for death at fractional ages, thus the EPVs must be **approximated from the discrete case**, which will be covered later.

### **Continuous Case**

As $m \to \infty$, then the survival model becomes $T_x$ and hence random variable is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{PV}
    &= v^{T_x} \\
    &= e^{-\delta \cdot T_x}
\end{aligned}
$$

The EPV of an assurance payable continously is denoted with the **$\bar{}$ accent** with the same notations as before:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \bar{A}_x
    &= \int^{\infty}_{0} v^{T_x} \cdot f_x(t) \\
    &= \int^{\infty}_{0} e^{-\delta \cdot T_x}  \cdot {}_{t}p_{x} \mu_{x+t}
\end{aligned}
$$

Recall that the second term represents the probability of living to a certain age $x+t$ and then dying in an infinitely small time after that (definition of force of interest).

Thus, although the EPV looks very different, it is still fundamentally a **Triple Product Summation** of the same components:

1. Amount of Benefit, 1
2. Discounting of the Benefit, $e^{-\delta \cdot T_x}$
3. Probability of paying the Benefit, ${}_{t}p_{x} \mu_{x+t}$

Unlike the payable $m$ times case, the EPVs *can be calculated directly* if the survival distribution is provided. However, since they are special cases of the payable $m$ times case, it can also be calculated through approximation from the discrete case.

The same logic can be applied to all other assurances, **EXCEPT for PEs**. This is because they pay out at a **fixed time**, thus there is **NO such thing** as a payable $m$ times PE or a continuously payable PE.

### **Uniform Distribution of Deaths**

Recall that the UDD assumption can be used to approximate survival probabilities of **fractional ages** from discrete probabilities. Using this approach, the Continuous EPVs can be approximated from the Discrete ones.

Assuming UDD between integer ages,

$$
    {}_{\frac{j}{m}}p_{x+K_x} \cdot {}_{\frac{1}{m}} q_{x+K_x+\frac{j}{m}} \approx \frac{1}{m} \cdot q_{x+K_x}
$$

Thus, the EPV of a continuous contract can be expressed as a function of the discrete case:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    A^{(m)}_{x}
    &= \sum^{\infty}_{K_x=0} v^{K_x} {}_{K_x}p_x  \cdot \sum^{m-1}_{j=0} v^{\frac{j+1}{m}} {}_{\frac{j}{m}}p_{x+K_x} \cdot {}_{\frac{1}{m}} q_{x+K_x+\frac{j}{m}} \\
    & \approx \sum^{\infty}_{K_x=0} v^{K_x} {}_{K_x}p_x  \cdot \sum^{m-1}_{j=0} v^{\frac{j+1}{m}} \frac{1}{m} \cdot q_{x+K_x} \\
    & \approx \sum^{\infty}_{K_x=0} v^{K_x+1} {}_{K_x}p_x q_{x+K_x} \cdot \frac{1}{m} \sum^{m-1}_{j=0} v^{\frac{j+1}{m}-1}   \\
    & \approx A_x \cdot \frac{v^{-1}}{m} \sum^{m-1}_{j=0} v^{\frac{j+1}{m}} \\
    & \approx A_x \cdot \frac{1+i}{m} \cdot \frac{v^{\frac{1}{m}}(1-v)}{1-v^{\frac{1}{m}}} \\
    & \approx A_x \cdot \frac{1+i}{m} \cdot \frac{v^{\frac{1}{m}}(1-v)}{v^{\frac{1}{m}}[(1+i)^{m}-1]} \\
    & \approx A_x \cdot \frac{1+i}{m} \cdot \frac{1-v}{(1+i)^{m}-1} \\
    & \approx A_x \cdot \frac{1+i-1}{m[(1+i)^{m}-1]} \\
    & \approx \frac{i}{i^{(m)}} \cdot A_x
\end{aligned}
$$

As $m \to \infty$,

$$
\begin{aligned}
    i^{(m)} &\to \delta, \\
    A^{(m)}_{x} &\to \bar{A}_x, \\
    \therefore  \bar{A}_x &= \frac{i}{\delta} A_x
\end{aligned}
$$

### **Claims Acceleration Approach**

Given that claims occur every $\frac{1}{m}$ period, then **on average**, the claims **within a year** occur at $\frac{m+1}{2m}$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{Average Death}
    &= \frac{\frac{1}{m} + \frac{m}{m}}{2} \\
    &= \frac{\frac{1+m}{m}}{2} \\
    &= \frac{m+1}{2m}
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, the EPV of a continuous contract can be expressed as a function of the discrete case:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    A^{(m)}_{x}
    & \approx \sum^{\infty}_{K_x = 0} v^{K_x + \frac{m+1}{2m}} {}_{K_x|} q_{x} \\
    & \approx v^{\frac{m+1}{2m}-1} \sum^{\infty}_{K_x = 0} v^{K_x + 1} {}_{K_x|} q_{x} \\
    & \approx v^{\frac{m+1-2m}{2m}} A_x \\
    & \approx v^{\frac{-m+1}{2m}} A_x \\
    & \approx v^{-\frac{m-1}{2m}} A_x \\
    & \approx (1+i)^{\frac{m-1}{2m}} A_x
\end{aligned}
$$

As $m \to \infty$,

$$
\begin{aligned}
    m &\to \infty, \\
    \frac{m-1}{2m} &\to \frac{1}{2}, \\
    A^{(m)}_{x} &\to \bar{A}_x, \\
    \therefore  \bar{A}_x &= (1+i)^{\frac{1}{2}} A_x
\end{aligned}
$$

This is known as the **Claims Acceleration Approach** as the claims are paid out earlier on in the year as compared to the end. Generally speaking, this approach is *preferred* as it only has one parameter compared to UDD which has two.

### **Common Pitfalls**

Recall that there are no continuous PEs - thus, be very careful when approximating an EA as **ONLY the TA portion needs to be approximated**!

This means that we **cannot directly apply** an approximation to the EA values provided in the SULT - they must be broken down into the TA and EA components first.

If calculating manually, it is always advised to calculate the TA and EA components seperately before combining into an EA to prevent falling into the trap of directly approximating the EA.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \bar{A}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} & \ne \frac{i}{\delta} A_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} \\
    \bar{A}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} & = \frac{i}{\delta} A^{1}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} + {}_{n}E_x
\end{aligned}
$$

Similarly, if approximating the second moment for variance, note that the **NEW interest rate must be used** in the approximation term as well:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}^{2} \bar{A}_x &= \frac{i^*}{\delta^*} \cdot {}^{2} A_x
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Note

    Although the above two points were illustrated with UDD, they apply to the claims acceleration approach as well.

Lastly, the two approaches should produce **similar results** which differ by a few decimal places. However, these **differences are enlarged** when dealing with large benefits as these decimal places will be brought forward, resulting in *seemingly* large differences - do not be alarmed!
