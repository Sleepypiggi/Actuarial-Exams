# **Life Assurances**

Life Assurances are contracts that promise to pay out a benefit *if* the insured event occurs in the *future*.

The value of a life assurance must reflect these two aspects:

1. Uncertainty of cashflows - **Expected Value**, based on Survival Models
2. Time value of money - **Present Value**, based on Interest Theory

Thus, the value of a life assurance is the **Expected Present Value** (EPV) of the promised cashflows.

## **Payable Discretely**

The simplest form of life assurance pays the benefits at the **end of the year** that the insured event occurs.

> While not common in practice, it provides a simple framework to understand the core concepts.

For an assurance payable discretely, **$K_x$ is used as the survival model**. Thus, the **present value** of the benefit payable in each period is $v^{K_x + 1}$.

The EPV is the **Triple Product Summation** of the various components:

1. **Amount** of benefit, $B$
2. **Discounting** of the benefit, $v^{K_x + 1}$
3. **Probability** of paying the benefit, ${}_{K_x}p_{x} {}_{}q_{x + K_x}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
    EPV
    &= \sum B \cdot v^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x}p_{x} {}_{}q_{x + K_x} \\
    &= \sum B \cdot v^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x|}q_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

For simplicity, all of the proofs in this section will use $B=1$. This also has the benefit of allowing the EPVs to be *easily scaled* for any level of $B$.

### **Actuarial Notation**

Similar to the survival model, given how often these values are calculated, they are abbreviated using the **International Actuarial Notation** as well.

$A$ represents the **first moment** (expectation) of the **present value** of a contract where a **benefit of 1** is payable discretely when the *status fails*.

The subscript $x$ is the age of the policyholder, known as the **Life Status**. It fails when the policyholder *dies*.

An additional subscript $:\enclose{actuarial}{n}$ is the duration that the assurance remains valid, known as the **Duration Status**. It fails if the policyholder *survives* past the policyterm.

A $1$ above the status indicates that the assurance pays **only** pays if that **particular status fails first**. If nothing is indicated, then the assurance pays whichever status fails first.

> If a particular status is omitted, then the assurance is not dependent on that status. For instance, omitting the duration status means that the contract is only dependent on the age of the policyholder.

An assurance that **begins $n$ years later** is known as a **Deferred Assurance**, which is denoted by ${}_{n|}A$, following the same notation as deferred probabilities.

Thus, putting everything together, the EPV of each assurance can be denoted as follows:

* **Whole Life Assurance** - Payable whenever policyholder dies; $A_x$
* **Term Assurance** - Payable only if policyholder dies during assurance period; $A^{1}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}$
* **Pure Endowment** - Payable only if policyholder survives past assurance period; $A^{\>\>\> 1}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}$
* **Endowment Assurance** - Payable whichever of the above two occur first; $A_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}$
* **Deferred Whole Life Assurance** - Payable only if policyholder dies after $n$ years; ${}_{n|}A_x$

Pure Endowments can also be expressed as ${}_{n}E_x$ for easier typesetting.

### **Whole Life Assurance**

**Whole Life Assurances** cover the insured **indefinitely** and thus *will* pay out *whenever* the insured dies.

Let WL be the random variable denoting the PV of the death benefit:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{WL} &= v^{K_x + 1} \\
    K_x &= 0, 1, \dots, \infty
\end{aligned}
$$

> Technically speaking, the upper limit of $K_x$ should $\omega-x$ as it represents the **maximum attainable age** in the discrete survival model.
>
> However, since the ${}_{k}p_{x} = 0$ for all $k \ge \omega-x$, it **does not matter** what the upper limit is as long as it is larger than $\omega-x$. Thus, $\infty$ is used for conciseness instead.

<!-- Self Made -->
![WL Discrete](Assets/3.%20Life%20Assurances.md/WL%20Discrete.png){.center}

The EPV is the **Expectation/First Moment** of the WL random variable:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E(\text{WL}) &= \sum^\infty_{K_x = 0} v^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x|}q_{x} \\
    A_{x} &= \sum^\infty_{K_x = 0} v^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x|}q_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

Another commonly used metric is the **Variance** of the contract. In order to get it, the **Second Moment** must first be determined:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E({\text{WL}}^2)
    &= \sum^\infty_{K_x = 0} \left(v^{K_x + 1}\right)^2 \cdot {}_{K_x|}q_{x} \\
    &= \sum^\infty_{K_x = 0} \left((v^2)^{K_x + 1}\right) \cdot {}_{K_x|}q_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

Notice that the expression can be simplified to a form that looks **almost identical to the first moment** - with the only difference being that is uses $v^2$ instead of $v$.

Thus, the second moment is simply the first moment **evaluated at a higher interest rate** $i^*=(1+i)^2-1$, such that $v^* = v^2$.

Generally, the **k-th moment** is denoted as ${}^{k}A_x$, where the $k$ is the **multiplier on the interest rate** used to evaluate the moment, $i^*=(1+i)^k-1$.

> It can also be written as $A_x |_{i = (1+i)^2-1}$ using non-actuarial notation, which will come in handy for more complicated expressions.

The **Second Moment** and hence **Variance** can be shown as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E({\text{WL}}^2) &= \sum^\infty_{K_x = 0} (v^2)^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x|}q_{x} \\
    {}^{2} A_{x} &= \sum^\infty_{K_x = 0} (v^*)^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x|}q_{x} \\
    \\
    \therefore Var(\text{WL}) &= {}^{2} A_{x} - (A_{x})^2
\end{aligned}
$$

Note that the **actual benefit must also be squared** - this is likely to result in a relatively **large value** for the second moment and variance.

### **Term Assurance**

**Term Assurance** covers the insured for a **specified period $n$** and only pays out *if* the insured dies within that period. **NOTHING** is paid out if the insured *survives beyond* that.

> A WL Assurance can be thought of as a special Term Assurance with infinite coverage.

Let TA be the random variable denoting the PV of the death benefit:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{TA} &=
    \begin{cases}
        v^{K_x + 1} ,& K_x = 0, 1, \dots, n-1 \\
        0 ,& K_x \ge n
    \end{cases} \\
    &= {}_{\{K_x \le n-1\}} v^{K_x+1}
\end{aligned}
$$

$\{K_x \le n-1\}$ is known as an **Indicator Function**, which is a binary variable that takes **1 if the condition is true and 0 if the condition if false**. It provides a concise way to express a piecewise function in a single expression.

<!-- Self Made -->
![TA Discrete](Assets/3.%20Life%20Assurances.md/TA%20Discrete.png)

The EPV is the **expectation** of the TA random variable:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E(\text{TA}) &= \sum^{n-1}_{K_x = 0} v^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x|}q_{x} + 0 \cdot {}_{n}p_{x} \\
    A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} &= \sum^{n-1}_{K_x = 0} v^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x|}q_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

Similar as before, the second moment and thus **Variance** can be calculated as the following:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E({\text{TA}}^2) &= \sum^{n-1}_{K_x = 0} (v^2)^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x|}q_{x} + 0^2 \cdot {}_{n}p_{x} \\
    {}^{2} A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} &= \sum^\infty_{K_x = 0} (v^*)^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x|}q_{x} \\
    \\
    \therefore Var(\text{TA}) &= {}^{2} A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} - (A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}})^2
\end{aligned}
$$

### **Pure Endowment**

**Pure Endowments** are a special kind of contract that instead only pays out *if* the insured **survives** past a specified period $n$. **NOTHING** is paid out if the insured *dies before* that.

Let PE be the random variable denoting the PV of the survival benefit:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{PE} &=
    \begin{cases}
        0 ,& K_x = 0, 1, 2 \dots, n \\
        v^n ,& K_x \ge n
    \end{cases}
\end{aligned}
$$

<!-- Self Made -->
![PE Discrete](Assets/3.%20Life%20Assurances.md/PE%20Discrete.png){.center}

The EPV is the **expectation** of the PE random variable. However, note that the probability of surviving past the period is given by a *single probability* ${}_{n}p_{x}$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E(\text{PE}) &= 0 \cdot {}_{n}q_{x} + v^n {}_{n}p_{x} \\
    {}_{n}E_x &= v^n {}_{n}p_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

Similar as before, the second moment and thus **Variance** can be calculated:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E({\text{PE}}^2) &= 0^2 \cdot {}_{n}q_{x} + (v^2)^n {}_{n}p_{x} \\
    {}^{2}_{n}E_x &= (v^*)^n {}_{n}p_{x} \\
    \\
    \therefore Var(\text{PE}) &= {}^{2}_{n}E_x - ({}_{n}E_x)^2
\end{aligned}
$$

### **Endowment Assurance**

**Endowment Assurances** are a *combination* of term assurances and pure endowments:

* **Term Assurance** - Pays out if the insured dies within the period
* **Pure Endowment** - Pays out if the insured survives past the period
* Thus, endowment assurances WILL pay out no matter what

Let EA be the random variable denoting the PV of the benefits:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{EA}
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        v^{K_x + 1} ,& K_x = 0, 1, \dots, n-1 \\
        v^n ,& K_x \ge n
    \end{cases} \\
    &= v^{min(K_x + 1, n)}
\end{aligned}
$$

<!-- Self Made -->
![EA Discrete](Assets/3.%20Life%20Assurances.md/EA%20Discrete.png){.center}

The EPV is the **expectation** of the EA random variable:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E(\text{EA}) &= \sum^{n-1}_{K_x = 0} v^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x|}q_{x} + v^n {}_{n}p_{x} \\
    A_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} &= A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} + {}_{n}E_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

Note that the in the *final year* of the contract, the assurance **will pay $v^n$ regardless** of the outcome - TA pays if they die while PE pays if they survive. Thus, a simplification can be made to the EPV:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    A_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}
    &= \sum^{n-1}_{K_x = 0} v^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x|}q_{x} + v^n {}_{n}p_{x} \\
    &= \sum^{n-2}_{K_x = 0} v^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x}p_{x} {}_{}q_{x + K_x} + v^n {}_{n-1}p_{x} {}_{}q_{x + n - 1} + v^n {}_{n}p_{x} \\
    &= \sum^{n-2}_{K_x = 0} v^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x|}q_{x} + v^n ({}_{n-1}p_{x} {}_{}q_{x + n - 1} + {}_{n}p_{x}) \\
    &= \sum^{n-2}_{K_x = 0} v^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x|}q_{x} + v^n {}_{n-1}p_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

<!-- Self Made -->
![EA Discrete Simplified](Assets/3.%20Life%20Assurances.md/EA%20Discrete%20Simplified.png){.center}

Similar as before, the second moment and thus **Variance** can be calculated:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E(\text{EA}^2) &= \sum^{n-1}_{K_x = 0} (v^2)^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x|}q_{x} + (v^2)^n {}_{n}p_{x} \\
    {}^{2} A_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}
    &= \sum^{n-1}_{K_x = 0} (v^*)^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x|}q_{x} + (v^*)^n {}_{n}p_{x} \\
    &= {}^{2} A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} + {}^{2}_{n}E_x \\
    \\
    \therefore Var(\text{EA})
    &= {}^{2} A_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} - \left(A_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}\right)^2 \\
    &= \left({}^{2} A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} + {}^{2}_{n}E_x \right) - \left(A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} - ({}_{n}E_x) \right)^2 \\
    &= \left({}^{2} A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} + {}^{2}_{n}E_x \right) - \left[(A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}})^2 + 2(A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} \cdot {}_{n}E_x) + ({}_{n}E_x)^2 \right]
\end{aligned}
$$

The same outcome can be reached using a slightly different approach:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    Var(EA)
    &= Var(\text{TA} + \text{PE}) \\
    &= Var(\text{TA}) + Var(\text{PE}) + 2 Cov(\text{TA}, \text{PE}) \\
    &= Var(\text{TA}) + Var(\text{PE}) + 2 [E(\text{TA} \cdot \text{PE}) - E(\text{TA}) \cdot E(\text{PE})]
\end{aligned}
$$

Consider the distribution of TA and PE:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    TA \cdot PE
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        v^{K_x + 1} \cdot 0, K_x \lt n \\
        0 \cdot v^n, K_x \ge n
    \end{cases} \\
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        0, K_x \lt n \\
        0, K_x \ge n
    \end{cases} \\
    \\ \therefore E(\text{TA} \cdot \text{PE})
    &= 0 \cdot {}_{n}q_x + 0 \cdot {}_{n}p_x \\
    &= 0
\end{aligned}  
$$

This results in the same variance as before:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    Var(EA)
    &= Var(\text{TA}) + Var(\text{PE}) + 2 [E(\text{TA} \cdot \text{PE}) - E(\text{TA}) \cdot E(\text{PE})] \\
    &= {}^{2} A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} - (A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}})^2 + {}^{2}_{n}E_x - ({}_{n}E_x)^2 - 2(A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} \cdot {}_{n}E_x) \\
    &= \left({}^{2} A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} + {}^{2}_{n}E_x \right) - \left[(A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}})^2 + 2(A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} \cdot {}_{n}E_x) + ({}_{n}E_x)^2 \right] \\
\end{aligned}
$$

While this process might seem redundant, it provides an easy to understand example of how the variance of a combination of assurances is derived by considering the covariance.

### **Deferred Assurances**

Deferred Assurances are variations of any of the above assurances, where the assurance **starts $n$ years later rather** than immediately. While any assurance can be deferred, the most common is the **Deferred Whole Life**.

#### **Deferred WL**

Let DWL be the random variable denoting the PV of the benefits of a deferred whole life assurance:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{DWL}
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        0,& K_x = 0, 1, 2, \dots, n-1 \\
        v^{K_x + 1} ,& K_x \ge n
    \end{cases} \\
    &= {}_{\{K_x \ge n\}} v^{K_x + 1}
\end{aligned}
$$

<!-- Self Made -->
![DWL Discrete](Assets/3.%20Life%20Assurances.md/DWL%20Discrete.png)

The EPV is the **expectation** of the DWL random variable:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E(\text{DWL}) &= 0 \cdot {}_{n}p_{x} + \sum^{\infty}_{K_x = n} v^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x|}q_{x} \\
    {}_{n|} A_{x}
    &= \sum^{\infty}_{K_x = 0} v^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x|}q_{x} - \sum^{n-1}_{K_x = 0} v^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x|}q_{x} \\
    &= A_x - A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}
\end{aligned}
$$

Alternatively, since a DWL is simply a WL assurance issued $n$ years later, the EPV of the DWL is equivalent to the EPV of a WL issued at age $x+n$ after **adjusting for interest and survival**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{n|} A_{x}
    &= \sum^{\infty}_{K_x = n} v^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x|}q_{x} \\
    &= \sum^{\infty}_{K_x = n} v^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x}p_{x} \cdot q_{x+K_x} \\
    &= \sum^{\infty}_{K_x = 0} v^{K_x + 1 + n} \cdot {}_{K_x+n}p_{x} \cdot q_{x+K_x+n} \\
    &= \sum^{\infty}_{K_x = 0} v^{K_x + 1} v^{n} \cdot {}_{n}p_{x} {}_{K_x}p_{x+n} \cdot q_{x+K_x+n} \\
    &= v^n {}_{n} p_{x} \sum^{\infty}_{K_x = 0} v^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x|}q_{x+n} \\
    &= {}_{n}E_{x} \cdot A_{x+n} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

> PEs can be use as a **discount factor** for functions that **takes mortality into consideration**. If provided by the life table, this reduces the need for computation.
>
> When going "back" in time, it must reflect that the policyholder will eventually survive till the current age, which is why the probability of surviving the period must be multiplied.

This allows a TA to be expressed as the **difference of two WL assurances issued at different times**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{n|} A_{x} &= {}_{n}E_{x} * A_{x+n} \\
    A_x - A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} &= {}_{n}E_{x} * A_{x+n} \\
    A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} &= A_{x} - {}_{n}E_{x} * A_{x+n} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

This result is **extremely important** as this is the main method of calculating the EPV of a TA as the values for the WL can be easily found in the SULT.

If the interest is not 0.05 or if mortality does NOT follow the SULT, then the EPV of a TA must be calculated manually. However, there is usually a catch that allows the EPV to be easily calculated manually:

* **Different Interest**: Term of the contract is short (EG. 3 Years)
* **Different Mortality**: Mortality can be simplified (EG. Becomes a constant)

> It is rare to have problems that have both different interest and mortality. In such cases, it is likely that an *adjusted* mortality table is provided.

<!-- Self Made -->
![DWL Difference](Assets/3.%20Life%20Assurances.md/DWL%20Difference.png){.center}

The second moment of a TA is still an expectation, thus the above method applies to it as well:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}^{2} A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}
    &= {}^{2} A_{x} - {}^{2}_{n} E_{x} \cdot {}^{2} A_{x+n}
\end{aligned}
$$

The key intuition is understanding that the **discounting factor should be squared** as well, which is why ${}^{2}_{n} E_{x}$ is used instead.

Finally, the variance of a DWL can be easily calculated by applying previous results:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    Var (DWL)
    &= {}^{2}_{n|}A_x - ({}_{n|}A_x)^2 \\
    &= \left({}^{2}A_x - {}^{2}A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}\right) - \left(A_x - A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}\right)^2 \\
    &= \left({}^{2}A_x - {}^{2}A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}\right) + \left[(A_x)^2 - 2(A_x)(A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}) + (A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}})^2 \right]
\end{aligned}
$$

#### **Deferred TA**

Another less commonly used deferred assurance is the **Deferred Term Assurance**. As both a **deferred and term** assurance, both results apply to it:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{k|}A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}
    &= {}_{k}E_{x} \cdot A^1_{x+k:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} \\
    &= {}_{k}E_{x} \cdot (A_{x+k} - {}_{n}E_{x} \cdot A_{x+k+n})
\end{aligned}
$$

Although rarely used, this result can be tricky due to the different PEs used to discount - one is for the deferred assurance while the other is for the term.

Alternatively, it can be used as a building block to decompose a regular assurance. An $n$ year term assurance can be thought of as the **sum of $n$ deferred TAs**, each with a one year term:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} &= \sum^{n-1}_{k=0} {}_{k|}A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{1}} \\
    A_{x} &= \sum^{\infty}_{k=0} {}_{k|}A_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

> Since WLs are just term assurances with infinite coverage, it can be extended to WLs as well if needed.
>
> This result will come in handy in later sections.

### **Recursions**

The EPV of each contract can also be expressed through **backwards recursion**, where it is calculated as a function of itself.

Consider the **WL** random variable:

* If the policyholder dies in the year, then a benefit of 1 is paid at the end of the year.
* If the policyholder survives past the year, then the policyholder will die in some future year. The PV of the benefit at the end of the year is given is the **EPV of the same contract but at that future time**; $A_{x+1}$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    WL
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        v \cdot 1 ,& {}_{}q_{x} \\
        v \cdot A_{x+1} ,& {}_{}p_{x}
    \end{cases}
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
    \therefore A_x = v{}_{}q_{x} + v{}_{}p_{x}A_{x+1}
$$

<!-- Self Made -->
![WL Recursion](Assets/3.%20Life%20Assurances.md/WL%20Recursion.png)

The same exercise can be shown for the **TA** random variable. The main difference is understanding how the age & duration changes:

* $x+1$ reflects the new age of the policyholder (same as WL)
* $n-1$ reflects that one year of coverage has passed (not applicable for WL)

$$
\begin{aligned}
    TA
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        v \cdot 1 ,& {}_{}q_{x} \\
        v \cdot A^1_{x+1:\enclose{actuarial}{n-1}} ,& {}_{}p_{x}
    \end{cases}
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
    \therefore A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} = v{}_{}q_{x} + v{}_{}p_{x}A^1_{x+1:\enclose{actuarial}{n-1}}
$$

> Note that since it requires a term policy with a *reduced term*, this recursion is not particularly useful as it is difficult to obtain it.

The **PE** variable is similar, with the main difference being that the policyholder will **receive nothing if the policyholder dies**. Thus, only the second component of the recursion remains:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    PE
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        0 ,& {}_{}q_{x} \\
        v \cdot {}_{n-1}E_{x+1} ,& {}_{}p_{x}
    \end{cases}
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
    \therefore {}_{n}E_{x} = v{}_{}p_{x} \cdot {}_{n-1}E_{x+1}
$$

> EA is omitted from this section as it is simply the combination of a TA and PE.

These identities are most useful in a spreadsheet setting where the calculations can be easily repeated to fill up an entire life table. However, even then it is necessary to have a *starting point* for the recusions to occur.

The most common starting point is the terminal age as the EPVs can be intuitively determined since the policyholder will **inevitably die** at the end of the year:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    A_{\omega-1} &= v \\
    A^{\> \> 1}_{\omega-1:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} &= v \\
    {}_{n}E_{\omega-1} &= 0 \\
    A^{1}_{\omega-1:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} &= v
\end{aligned}
$$

### **Intuitions**

Although the exam questions are mostly computational, it is good to have an understanding of how the different EPVs compare against one another to serve as a sort of "sense check" against the SULT provided to determine if the answer is in the right direction.

#### **Same Assurance**

Recall that the probability of death is an *increasing* function with age. The death benefit is **more likely to be paid out** to an older policyholder - in other words, they **receive the death benefit "sooner"** than a younger policyholder.

Thus, an older policyholder has **larger expected cashflows** that are **discounted less** (due to receiving it sooner), which results in a **higher EPV** than a younger policyholder, all else equal:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    A_{x+k} & \gt A_{x} \\
    A^{\> \> 1} _{x+k:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} & \gt A^{\> \> 1}_{x+k:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}
\end{aligned}
$$

Conversely, the probability of survival is a *decreasing* function with age. The survival benefit is **less likely to be paid out** to an older policyholder - smaller expected cashflows.

Regardless of the age of the policyholder, the survival benefit is paid at the same time (**same discounting**). Thus, since an older policyholder has **smaller expected cashflows**, it has a **lower EPV** than a younger policyholder:

$$
    {}_{n}E_{x+k} \le {}_{n}E_{x}
$$

Endowment Assurances have **both a death and survival component**, thus the comparison is a combination of the two:

* A younger policyholder is **more likely to survive** and receive the survival benefit at the end of the term (discounted more)
* An older policyholder is **more likely to die** and receive the death benefit during the term (discounted less)

Assuming that the difference in expected cashflows are *negligible*, then an older policyholder would have an **higher EPV** due to the **lower discounting**:

$$
    A_{x+k:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} \gt A_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}
$$

Naturally, all else equal, assurances with a **lower interest rate are discounted less** and thus have a **higher EPV**.

#### **Different Assurances**

At a **young age** where the probability of death is low, all else equal (where applicable), the EPVs of each assurance rank as follows:

1. **TA will have the smallest EPV**. Although their benefits are paid out sooner, the **expected benefits are small** as the probability of death is small.
2. **WL has the next largest EPV**. They have the same benefits as term in the short run, but have **large expected benefits in the future**. However, these large benefits are **heavily discounted**, still resuling in a small EPV.
3. **PE has the next largest EPV**. Given the high probability of survival, the **expected benefits are large**.
4. **EA has the largest EPV**. Since it is a combination of TA and PE, it is naturally the highest.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    A^{1}_{30:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} < A_{30} < {}_{n}E_{30} < A_{30:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

At an **old age** where the probability of death is high, all else equal (where applicable), the EPVs of each assurance rank as follows:

1. **PE will have the smallest EPV**. Given the low probability of survival, the **expected benefits are are small**.
2. **TA will have the next largest EPV**. Given the high probability of death, the **expected benefits are high**.
3. **EA will have the next largest EPV**. Since it is combination of TA and PE, it is naturally higher than both of them.
4. **WL has the largest EPV**. Given the inevitable death of the policyholder, the **expected benefits are the highest**.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{n}E_{100} < A^{1}_{100:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} < A_{100:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} < A_{100} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

As the policyholder approaches the terminal age, the EPVs tend to one another:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    x &\to \omega \\
    E(\text{PE}) &\to 0 \\
    E(\text{EA}) &\to E(\text{TA}) \\
    E(\text{TA}) &\to E(\text{WL})
\end{aligned}
$$

TA tends to WL whenever the **end of the term exceeds the terminal age** - thus the cashflows and hence EPV for both assurances become identical.

### **Probabilities and Percentiles**

Apart from just calculating the Expectation and Variance, the **probabilities** and hence **percentiles** of the contract benefits can be calculated as well.

The former refers to calculating the **probability that the random variable is at most some value** $u$. In other words, that the PV (**NOT the EPV!**) is at most $u$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{WL} &\le u \\
    v^{K_x+1} &\le u \\
    (K_x+1) &\ln v \le \ln u \\
    K_x+1 &\ge \frac{\ln u}{\ln v} \\
    K_x & \ge \frac{\ln u}{\ln v} - 1 \\
\end{aligned}
$$

Note that it is a **common mistake** to forget to flip the inequality sign as $\ln v \lt 0$. To avoid this error, it is advised to plot a graph to remember that $K_x$ should be **larger than** the calculated value:

<!-- Self Made -->
![WL Probability](Assets/3.%20Life%20Assurances.md/WL%20Probability.png){.center}

The RHS of the expression is unlikely to be an integer. However, $K_x$ can only take integer values. Thus, the values can **rounded up** to the nearest whole number (EG. 5):

$$
\begin{aligned}
    P(K_x \ge \frac{\ln u}{\ln v} - 1)
    &= P(K_x \ge 5) \\
    &= P(T_x \ge 5) \\
    &= {}_{5}p_x
\end{aligned}
$$

The latter refers to calculating the **percentile of the random variable**, which is the smallest value of the RV that results in the specified probability.

This process is the opposite of the previous one - it involves solving for $T_x$, converting it to $K_x$ and then subsituting it back into the RV, which results in the associated percentile.

## **Payable Continuously**

In practice, life assurances pay benefits **as soon as the insured event occurs**, thus is akin to paying out **continuously** throughout the year.

Notice that paying out continuously is actually a **special case** of a contract that pays out **$m$ times a year**, where $m$ tends to infinity.

* $m=4$; Quarterly Payments
* $m=12$; Monthly Payments
* $m=\infty$; Continuous Payments

Thus, despite the header stating "payable continously", this section will instead cover **paying out $m$ times a year**, which can be used to derive the continuous case.

> Note that questions with Assurances that pay out $m$ times a year are rare - if anything, the continuous case will be directly tested instead.
>
> However, the $m$ times a year case is still covered because the ideas can be extended to Annuities, where such questions are common.

The survival model used must now reflect the **probability of death at fractional ages**. Intuitively, it can be thought of as the probability *living till a discrete age* and then dying within a sub-period within that year:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    K_x + \frac{j+1}{m}, \>\> j = 0, 1, 2, ..., m-1
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, the corresponding random variable representing the PV of the benefits:

$$
    \text{PV} = v^{K_x + \frac{j+1}{m}}
$$

<!-- Self Made -->
![Continuous RV](Assets/3.%20Life%20Assurances.md/Continuous%20RV.png){.center}

The EPV of an assurance payable $m$ times a year can be denoted with the **$(m)$ superscript** with the same notations as before:

$$
    A^{(m)}_{x} = \sum^{\infty}_{K_x=0} v^{K_x} {}_{K_x}p_x  \cdot \sum^{m-1}_{j=0} v^{\frac{j+1}{m}} {}_{\frac{j}{m}}p_{x+K_x} \cdot {}_{\frac{1}{m}} q_{x+K_x+\frac{j}{m}} \\
$$

> Note that the benefit used is still the **ANNUAL BENEFIT**. To obtain the actual benefit payable per period, then it should be divided by the number of periods; $\frac{B}{m}$.

Unfortunately, most life tables do not naturally provide probabilities for death at fractional ages, thus the EPVs must be **approximated from the discrete case**, which will be covered later.

### **Continuous Case**

As $m \to \infty$, then the survival model becomes $T_x$ and hence random variable is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{PV}
    &= v^{T_x} \\
    &= e^{-\delta \cdot T_x}
\end{aligned}
$$

The EPV of an assurance payable continously is denoted with the **$\bar{}$ accent** with the same notations as before:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \bar{A}_x
    &= \int^{\infty}_{0} v^{T_x} \cdot f_x(t) \\
    &= \int^{\infty}_{0} e^{-\delta \cdot T_x}  \cdot {}_{t}p_{x} \mu_{x+t}
\end{aligned}
$$

Recall that the second term represents the probability of living to a certain age $x+t$ and then dying in an infinitely small time after that (definition of force of interest).

Thus, although the EPV looks very different, it is still fundamentally a **Triple Product Summation** of the same components:

1. Amount of Benefit, 1
2. Discounting of the Benefit, $e^{-\delta \cdot T_x}$
3. Probability of paying the Benefit, ${}_{t}p_{x} \mu_{x+t}$

Unlike the payable $m$ times case, the EPVs *can be calculated directly* if the survival distribution is provided. However, since they are special cases of the payable $m$ times case, it can also be calculated through approximation from the discrete case.

The same logic can be applied to all other assurances, **EXCEPT for PEs**. This is because they pay out at a **fixed time**, thus there is **NO such thing** as a payable $m$ times PE or a continuously payable PE..

### **Uniform Distribution of Deaths**

Recall that the UDD assumption can be used to approximate survival probabilities of **fractional ages** from discrete probabilities. Using this approach, the Continuous EPVs can be approximated from the Discrete ones.

Assuming UDD between integer ages,

$$
    {}_{\frac{j}{m}}p_{x+K_x} \cdot {}_{\frac{1}{m}} q_{x+K_x+\frac{j}{m}} \approx \frac{1}{m} \cdot q_{x+K_x}
$$

Thus, the EPV of a continuous contract can be expressed as a function of the discrete case:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    A^{(m)}_{x}
    &= \sum^{\infty}_{K_x=0} v^{K_x} {}_{K_x}p_x  \cdot \sum^{m-1}_{j=0} v^{\frac{j+1}{m}} {}_{\frac{j}{m}}p_{x+K_x} \cdot {}_{\frac{1}{m}} q_{x+K_x+\frac{j}{m}} \\
    & \approx \sum^{\infty}_{K_x=0} v^{K_x} {}_{K_x}p_x  \cdot \sum^{m-1}_{j=0} v^{\frac{j+1}{m}} \frac{1}{m} \cdot q_{x+K_x} \\
    & \approx \sum^{\infty}_{K_x=0} v^{K_x+1} {}_{K_x}p_x q_{x+K_x} \cdot \frac{1}{m} \sum^{m-1}_{j=0} v^{\frac{j+1}{m}-1}   \\
    & \approx A_x \cdot \frac{v^{-1}}{m} \sum^{m-1}_{j=0} v^{\frac{j+1}{m}} \\
    & \approx A_x \cdot \frac{1+i}{m} \cdot \frac{v^{\frac{1}{m}}(1-v)}{1-v^{\frac{1}{m}}} \\
    & \approx A_x \cdot \frac{1+i}{m} \cdot \frac{v^{\frac{1}{m}}(1-v)}{v^{\frac{1}{m}}[(1+i)^{m}-1]} \\
    & \approx A_x \cdot \frac{1+i}{m} \cdot \frac{1-v}{(1+i)^{m}-1} \\
    & \approx A_x \cdot \frac{1+i-1}{m[(1+i)^{m}-1]} \\
    & \approx \frac{i}{i^{(m)}} \cdot A_x
\end{aligned}
$$

As $m \to \infty$,

$$
\begin{aligned}
    i^{(m)} &\to \delta, \\
    A^{(m)}_{x} &\to \bar{A}_x, \\
    \therefore  \bar{A}_x &= \frac{i}{\delta} A_x
\end{aligned}
$$

### **Claims Acceleration Approach**

Given that claims occur every $\frac{1}{m}$ period, then **on average**, the claims **within a year** occur at $\frac{m+1}{2m}$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{Average Death}
    &= \frac{\frac{1}{m} + \frac{m}{m}}{2} \\
    &= \frac{\frac{1+m}{m}}{2} \\
    &= \frac{m+1}{2m}
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, the EPV of a continuous contract can be expressed as a function of the discrete case:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    A^{(m)}_{x}
    & \approx \sum^{\infty}_{K_x = 0} v^{K_x + \frac{m+1}{2m}} {}_{K_x|} q_{x} \\
    & \approx v^{\frac{m+1}{2m}-1} \sum^{\infty}_{K_x = 0} v^{K_x + 1} {}_{K_x|} q_{x} \\
    & \approx v^{\frac{m+1-2m}{2m}} A_x \\
    & \approx v^{\frac{-m+1}{2m}} A_x \\
    & \approx v^{-\frac{m-1}{2m}} A_x \\
    & \approx (1+i)^{\frac{m-1}{2m}} A_x
\end{aligned}
$$

As $m \to \infty$,

$$
\begin{aligned}
    m &\to \infty, \\
    \frac{m-1}{2m} &\to \frac{1}{2}, \\
    A^{(m)}_{x} &\to \bar{A}_x, \\
    \therefore  \bar{A}_x &= (1+i)^{2} A_x
\end{aligned}
$$

This is known as the **Claims Acceleration Approach** as the claims are paid out earlier on in the year as compared to the end.

### **Common Pitfalls**

Recall that there are no continuous PEs - thus, be very careful when approximating an EA as **ONLY the TA portion needs to be approximated**!

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \bar{A}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} & \ne \frac{i}{\delta} A_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} \\
    \bar{A}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} & = \frac{i}{\delta} A^{1}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} + {}_{n}E_x
\end{aligned}
$$

Similarly, if approximating the second moment for variance, note that the **NEW interest rate must be used** in the approximation term as well:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}^{2} \bar{A}_x &= \frac{i^*}{\delta^*} \cdot {}^{2} A_x
\end{aligned}
$$

> Although the above two points were illustrated with UDD, they apply to the claims acceleration approach as well.

Lastly, the two approaches should produce **similar results** which differ by a few decimal places. However, these differences are enlarged when dealing with large benefits as these decimal places will be brought forward, resulting in *seemingly* large differences - do not be alarmed!

## **Variable Benefits**

Previously, the benefit of the assurances were assumed to be **fixed at 1** for simplicity. In practice, it is common to have assurances where the benefits **change over time**.

### **Geometric Assurance**

If the benefits change by a **common factor** each period, then it is known as a **Geometric Assurance**.

The benefit of the policy **starts at 1** in the first year and **changes by $(1+b)$** each period:

* If $b>0$, then the assurance is **increasing**
* If $b<0$, then the assurance is **decreasing**

$$
    \text{Geometric Benefit} = (1+b)^{K_x}
$$

> Note that the power is $K_x$ and NOT $K_x+1$ to reflect that the benefit starts at 1 when $K_x=0$.

<!-- Self Made -->
![Geom Assurance](Assets/3.%20Life%20Assurances.md/Geom%20Assurance.png){.center}

Thus, the EPV of a WL Geometric Assurance can be shown to be:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{EPV Geom WL}
    &= \sum^{\infty}_{K_x=0} (1+b)^{K_x} v^{K_x+1} {}_{k|}q_x \\
    &= (1+b)^{-1} \sum^{\infty}_{K_x=0} (1+b)^{K_x+1} v^{K_x+1} {}_{k|}q_x \\
    &= \frac{1}{1+b} \sum^{\infty}_{K_x=0} \left(\frac{1+b}{1+i}\right)^{K_x+1} {}_{k|}q_x \\
    &= \frac{1}{1+b} \sum^{\infty}_{K_x=0} (v')^{K_x+1} {}_{k|}q_x \\
    &= \frac{1}{1+b} A_x |_{i=\frac{1+i}{1+b}-1}
\end{aligned}
$$

Note that this means that the term $A_x |_{i=\frac{1+i}{1+b}-1}$ by *itself* is a Geometric Assurance that **starts with payments of $(1+b)$**, which is why $\frac{1}{1+b}$ is required to scale it down by one factor such that it starts at one.

> The expression follows similar intuition to the second moment - it is simply a regular EPV expression evaluated at a **different interest rate**. Unfortunately, there is no specified actuarial notation for this unique case.

### **Arithmetic Assurance**

If the benefits change by a **fixed constant** each period, then it is instead known as an **Arithmetic Assurance**.

Arithmetic WLs can ONLY be increasing, as a decreasing one would inevitably result in negative benefits, which is unintuitive. The benefit of the policy **starts at 1** in the first year and **increases by $1$** each period:

$$
    \text{Arithmetically Increasing Benefit} = k+1
$$

<!-- Self Made -->
![Arithmetic Assurance](Assets/3.%20Life%20Assurances.md/Arithmetic%20Assurance.png){.center}

Thus, the EPV of a WL Arithmetic Assurance can be shown to be:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{EPV Arith WL} &= \sum^{\infty}_{K_x=0} (k+1) v^{K_x+1} {}_{k|}q_x \\
    (IA)_x &= \sum^{\infty}_{K_x=0} (k+1) v^{K_x+1} {}_{k|}q_x
\end{aligned}
$$

Intuitively, it can also be shown to be a **sum of deferred WLs**, each deferred by one period from the previous. This creates a **step-like function** which creates the increasing effect of the assurance:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    (IA)_x
    &= {}_{0|}A_x + {}_{1|}A_x + {}_{2|}A_x + ... \\
    &= \sum^{\infty}_{K_x = 0} {}_{K_x|}A_x
\end{aligned}
$$

> The $I$ is actuarial notation for an Assurance or Annuity with *Arithmetically increasing* benefits.

<!-- Self Made -->
![Arithmetic Deferred](Assets/3.%20Life%20Assurances.md/Arithmetic%20Deferred.png){.center}

#### **Arithmetic Term**

For a non-variable assurance, a term can be expressed as a **difference of two WLs** issued at different times because the benefits for the time after the specified term would *cancel out*.

For a variable assurance, this is slightly more complicated as the value of both WLs **would not cancel out**:

* The "earlier" WL would have increased significantly from its starting value
* The "later" WL would only be at its starting value

Thus, an additional term needs to be subtracted in order to remove the remaining portion of the benefit past the specified term:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{EPV Arith Increasing TA} &= \sum^{n-1}_{K_x=0} (k+1) v^{K_x+1} {}_{k|}q_x \\
    (IA)^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} &= (IA)_x - {}_{n}E_x [(IA)_{x+n} + nA_{x+n}]
\end{aligned}
$$

<!-- Self Made -->
![Increasing Term](Assets/3.%20Life%20Assurances.md/Increasing%20Term.png)

Unlike WLs, arithmetic TAs can be *decreasing*, as long as the benefit does not become negative. In other words, the benefit of the policy **starts at n** and **decreases by 1** each period:

$$
    \text{Arithmetically Decreasing Benefit} = n-k
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{EPV Arith Decreasing TA} &= \sum^{\infty}_{K_x=0} (n-k) v^{K_x+1} {}_{k|}q_x \\
    (D_{\enclose{actuarial}{n}}A)_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}
    &= \sum^{\infty}_{K_x=0} (n-k+1-1) v^{K_x+1} {}_{k|}q_x \\
    &= \sum^{\infty}_{K_x=0} (n+1) v^{K_x+1} {}_{k|}q_x - \sum^{\infty}_{K_x=0} (k+1) v^{K_x+1} {}_{k|}q_x \\
    &= (n+1)A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} - (IA)^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}
\end{aligned}
$$

> The $D$ is actuarial notation for an Assurance or Annuity with *Arithmetically decreasing* benefits.
>
> Note that the duration status is written next to it to signify how long the decrease takes place; it is separate from the duration status of the entire assurance/annuity.

<!-- Self Made -->
![Decreasing Term](Assets/3.%20Life%20Assurances.md/Decreasing%20Term.png)

#### **Continuous Arithmetic**

This could refer to two types of assurances:

1. Discretely changing but continuously payable
2. Continuously changing and continuously payable

For the first case, it is simply an arithmetic assurance with one of the **continuous approximations** applied:

$$
    (I\bar{A})_x = \frac{i}{\delta} (IA)_x
$$

The second case is more interesting as it refers to an assurance where the benefits **changes continuosly** throughout the period.

It is assumed that the benefit **changes at a constant rate** throughout the period, such that the **total change is equal to 1**.

$$
    (\bar{I}\bar{A})_{x} = \int^{\infty}_0 t v^t \cdot {}_{t}p_x \cdot \mu_{x+t}
$$

This can be more easily approximated from the "discrete" case:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    (\bar{I}\bar{A})_{x} &= (I\bar{A})_{x} - \frac{1}{2} \cdot 1 \cdot 1 \cdot \bar{A}_x \\
    (\bar{I}\bar{A})_{x} &= (I\bar{A})_{x} - \frac{1}{2} \bar{A}_x
\end{aligned}
$$

<!-- Self Made -->
![Continuously Variable](Assets/3.%20Life%20Assurances.md/Continuously%20Variable.png){.center}

### **Variable Recursions**

Since the benefit payable at the end of the first year is **still 1**, the recursion for variable assurances are similar to the level assurances:

* If the policyholder dies in the current year with probability $q_x$, then a benefit of 1 is paid at the end of the year - this is exactly the same as before.
* However, if the policyholder lives past the current year with probability $p_x$, then the policyholder will receive **future benefits** that are **larger than 1** at some future time.

For the second half, the term multiplied must be the EPV of an assurance that **starts with an increased benefit** of $(1+b)$ or $2$. The issue is that the random variable is currently defined as a contract with benefits *starting at 1*, which is why the recursive formula is different from the level case.

For Geometric Assurances, $A_{x+1}|_{i=\frac{1+i}{1+b}-1}$ is **already** an Geometric Assurance that starts at $(1+b)$, thus the recursive formula is simply:

$$
    \text{EPV Geom WL}_{x} = vq_x + vp_x A_{x+1}|_{i=\frac{1+i}{1+b}-1}
$$

For Arithmetic Assurances, an EPV representing an **additional benefit of 1 each period** must be added that the expression starts from 2 and increases by 1 each period.

$$
    (IA)_{x} = vq_x + vp_x[(IA)_{x+1} + A_{x+1}]
$$

The same can be shown for Variable Term Assurances, but remember that the **remaining duration of the policy must decrease** as well.

### **Variance and Second Moment**

Consider the second moment of both types of variable assurances:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E\left[(\text{Arith WL})^2\right]
    &= \sum^{\infty}_{K_x=0} (k+1)^2 (v^2)^{K_x+1} {}_{k|}q_x \\
    \\
    E\left[(\text{Geom WL})^2\right]
    &= \sum^{\infty}_{K_x=0} (1+b)^{2K_x} (v^2)^{K_x+1} {}_{k|}q_x
\end{aligned}
$$

Notice that the usual approximation of $v=v^2$ is **insufficient** to solve for the second moment due to the squared benefit. Thus, there are no ${}^{2}A$ defined for variable assurances.
