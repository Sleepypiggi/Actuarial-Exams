# **Reserves**

Most life insurance contracts charge **level premiums** - charging the same amount throughout the lifetime of the policy.

When the policyholder is young, the probability of death is small, thus the premiums collected are **larger** than the expected outflow in the year, leading to a **surplus**.

When the policyholder is older, the probability of death is high, thus the premiums collected are **smaller** than the expected outflow in the year, leading to a **deficit**.

Given the inevitable deficit, the surplus in the earlier years cannot be recognized as a profit and are instead **pooled together and safely invested** into an account, from which the deficit in later years will draw from.

> It is a common misconception to think that each policy has its own account. Following this logic, the insurer would not have enough funds to pay an insured who dies shortly after death.

In order to determine the adequacy of the account, insurers will calculate the **size of the expected loss** of ALL policies and compare it against the (hopefully larger) account value.

The expected loss is known as the **Reserve** of the policy because it represents an amount inside the pooled account that is *reserved* for paying the benefits of the policy.

## **Reserve Calculation**

There are two approaches to calculate the reserves:

* **Prospective Approach** - Based on Present Values
* **Retrospective Approach** - Based on Future Values
* For the purposes of this exam, only the **Prospective Approach** is covered

Let ${}_{t}V$ represent the Reserve of the policy at time $t$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t}V
    &= E(L_x) \\
    &= \text{PV Benefits}_{x+t} - \text{PV Premiums}_{x+t}
\end{aligned}
$$

> Note that the reference point for Reserves are usually age $x+t$, rather than the usual $x$.

Naturally, there are two types of reserves, following the two types of premiums - **Net** & **Gross**. For simplicity, this section will focus on the **Net Premium Reserve** for a WL policy.

> The same principles can be easily applied to gross premiums or other types of assurances.

Net Premium Reserves can be simplified into an expression involving the following, which allow it to be easily calculated in situations where limited information is given:

1. Annuities only
2. Assurances only
3. Annuities and Premiums
4. Assurance and Premiums

### **Case 1: Annuities Only**

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t}V
    &= A_{x+t} - P \ddot{a}_{x+t} \\
    &= A_{x+t} - \frac{A_x}{\ddot{a}_x} \cdot \ddot{a}_{x+t} \\
    &= (1-\delta\ddot{a}_{x+t}) - \frac{1-\delta\ddot{a}_{x}}{\ddot{a}_{x}} \cdot \ddot{a}_{x+t} \\
    &= 1-\delta\ddot{a}_{x+t} - \left (\frac{1}{\ddot{a}_x}-\delta \right) \cdot \ddot{a}_{x+t} \\
    &= 1-\delta\ddot{a}_{x+t} - \frac{\ddot{a}_{x+t}}{\ddot{a}_x} + \delta\ddot{a}_{x+t} \\
    &= 1 - \frac{\ddot{a}_{x+t}}{\ddot{a}_x}
\end{aligned}
$$

### **Case 2: Assurances Only**

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t}V
    &= A_{x+t} - P \ddot{a}_{x+t} \\
    &= A_{x+t} - \frac{A_x}{\ddot{a}_x} \cdot \ddot{a}_{x+t} \\
    &= A_{x+t} - \frac{A_x}{\frac{1-A_x}{d}} \cdot \frac{1-A_{x+t}}{d} \\
    &= A_{x+t} - \frac{A_x}{1-A_x} \cdot (1-A_{x+t}) \\
    &= \frac{A_{x+t} \cdot (1-A_{x}) - A_x(1-A_{x+t})}{1-A_x} \\
    &= \frac{A_{x+t} - A_{x}A_{x+t} - A_x + A_x A_{x+t}}{1-A_x} \\
    &= \frac{A_{x+t} - A_{x}}{1 - A_{x}}
\end{aligned}
$$

### **Case 3: Annuities & Premiums**

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t}V
    &= A_{x+t} - P_x \cdot \ddot{a}_{x+t} \\
    &= \ddot{a}_{x+t} \cdot \left(\frac{A_{x+t}}{\ddot{a}_{x+t}} - P_{x} \right) \\
    &= \ddot{a}_{x+t} \cdot (P_{x+t} - P_{x})
\end{aligned}
$$

### **Case 4: Assurances & Premiums**

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t}V
    &= A_{x+t} - P_x \cdot \ddot{a}_{x+t} \\
    &= A_{x+t} (1 - P_x \cdot \frac{\ddot{a}_{x+t}}{A_{x+t}}) \\
    &= A_{x+t} (1 - P_x \cdot \frac{1}{\frac{A_{x+t}}{\ddot{a}_{x+t}}}) \\
    &= A_{x+t} (1 - \frac{P_x}{P_{x+t}})
\end{aligned}
$$

Based on the equivalence principle approach, premiums are set such that **expected loss is 0** at time 0, thus the **reserve at that time is also 0**:

$$
    {}_{0}V = 0
$$

### **Reserve VS Premiums**

Notice that both reserves and premium involve the expectation of the random variable $L$:

* When calculating premiums, $P$ is the target while $E(L_x)$ is given
* When calculating reserves, $E(L_x)$ is the target while $P$ is given

Another key difference is the **reference point** - Premiums are calculated at age $x$ while Reserves at age $x+t$, resulting in a different $L$

However, a newly issued policy for another individual aged $x+t$ uses the exact same $L$ as the reserve, $L_{x+t}$. This is why some of the expressions involve $P_{x+t}$, which is the premium of this newly issued policy.

## **Recursions**

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t}V
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        v + P ,& q_{x+t} \\
        v \cdot {}_{t+1}V + P ,& p_{x+t}
    \end{cases} \\
    \\
    \therefore
    {}_{t}V
    &= q_{x+t} \cdot (v + P) + p_{x+t} (v \cdot {}_{t+1}V + P) \\
    &= q_{x+t} \cdot v + p_{x+t} \cdot v \cdot {}_{t+1}V + P
\end{aligned}
$$

## **Full Preliminary Term Reserves**

The method and basis for calculating the reserve is based on the prevailing regulation at that time and region. In the US, reserves are calculated using **Net Premiums** due to its simplicity.

However, this comes at the cost of accuracy, as net premium reserves tend to be **too conservative**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t}v^{\text{Gross}} &= {}_{t}v^{\text{Net}} + {}_{t}v^{\text{Expense}} \\
    {}_{t}v^{\text{Net}} &= {}_{t}v^{\text{Gross}} - \underbrace{{}_{t}v^{\text{Expense}}}_{\text{-ve}} \\
    {}_{t}v^{\text{Net}} &\gt {}_{t}v^{\text{Gross}}
\end{aligned}
$$

In order to overcome this difference, the net premium approach is modified to better reflect actual experience while still retaining the benefits of using net premiums, known as the **Full Preliminary Term Reserves**.

### **Negative Expense Reserve**

Based on the equivalence principle approach, **on average**, premiums are expected to cover all benefits and expenses.

However, **acquisition expenses** in the first year are often much higher than the renewal expenses, resulting in a positive loss in the first year.

Thus, in all subsequent years, there is a negative loss to gradually recover the positive loss made in the first year. This results in a **negative reserve** at the end of the first year because the loss in all future years are negative.

A negative reserve implies that expected inflows are larger than outflows, thus the insurer can **treat the policy as an asset** and thus hold less capital overall to cover other liabilities.

To be conservative, regulators do not allow insurers to recognize a negative reserve. Thus, any negative reserves will be **floored at 0**.

### **Modified Approach**

Assume that the policy has **non-level premiums**:

* Acquisition Premium, $\alpha$
* Renewal Premium, $\beta$

The goal is to calculate a $\beta$ such that the reserve at *time 1* is 0, **replicating the result** under gross premium:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{1}V^{\text{FPT}} &= 0 \\
    A_{x+1} - \beta \ddot{a}_{x+1} &= 0 \\
    \beta &= \frac{A_{x+1}}{\ddot{a}_{x+1}}
\end{aligned}
$$

> Note that for a TA, the duration of the policy would have to decrease by 1 year as well.

Following the equivalence principle, the reserve at time 0 must still be 0, thus $\alpha$ is calculated as the **Single Premium** equal to the expected loss at inception:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{0}V^{\text{FPT}} &= 0 \\
    \alpha &= A_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, the modified reserves at all later times follows the same formula as before, simply using $\beta$ instead:

$$
    {}_{t}V^{\text{FPT}} = A_{x+t} - \beta \ddot{x+t}
$$

Note that $\beta$ can also be thought of as the net premium for a policy that is:

1. Issued one year later; $x+1$
2. One less year passed; $t-1, n-1$

$$
    \therefore {}_{t}V^{\text{FPT}} = {}_{t-1}V^{\text{Net}}_{\text{One year later, one less year}}
$$
