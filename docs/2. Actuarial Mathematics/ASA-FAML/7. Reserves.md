# **Reserves**

Most life insurance contracts charge **level premiums** - charging the same amount throughout the lifetime of the policy.

When the policyholder is young, the probability of death is small, thus the premiums collected are **larger** than the expected outflow in the year, leading to a **surplus**.

When the policyholder is older, the probability of death is high, thus the premiums collected are **smaller** than the expected outflow in the year, leading to a **deficit**.

Given the inevitable deficit, the surplus in the earlier years cannot be recognized as a profit and are instead **pooled together and safely invested** into an account, from which the deficit in later years will draw from.

> It is a common misconception to think that each policy has its own account. Following this logic, the insurer would not have enough funds to pay an insured who dies shortly after death.

In order to determine the adequacy of the account, insurers will calculate the **size of the expected loss** of ALL policies and compare it against the (hopefully larger) account value.

The expected loss is known as the **Reserve** of the policy because it represents an amount inside the pooled account that is *reserved* for paying the benefits of the policy.

## **Retrospective Approach**

There are two approaches to calculate the reserves:

* **Prospective Approach** - Based on Present Values
* **Retrospective Approach** - Based on Future Values (Not covered)

Similar to premiums, there are also two types of reserves, depending on what cashflows are being considered:

* **Net Premium Reserves** - Net Premiums and Benefits
* **Gross Premium Reserves** - Gross Premiums, Benefits and Expenses

While this looks similar to premium calculation, note that the Gross *Reserves* do NOT include any other cashflows (EG. Profit Margin). This is intuitive, as reserves should only be to meet **essential cashflows**.

Let ${}_{t}V$ represent the Reserve in policy year $t$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t}V
    &= E(L_{x+t}) \\
    &= \text{PV Benefits}_{x+t} - \text{PV Premiums}_{x+t}
\end{aligned}
$$

Similar to premiums, we will only define formulas for the **Net Premium Reserves**. They can be simplified into an expression involving only the following, which allows it to be easily calculated in situations where limited information is provided:

1. Annuities only
2. Assurances only
3. Annuities and Premiums
4. Assurance and Premiums

### **Case 1: Annuities Only**

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t}V
    &= A_{x+t} - P \ddot{a}_{x+t} \\
    &= A_{x+t} - \frac{A_x}{\ddot{a}_x} \cdot \ddot{a}_{x+t} \\
    &= (1-\delta\ddot{a}_{x+t}) - \frac{1-\delta\ddot{a}_{x}}{\ddot{a}_{x}} \cdot \ddot{a}_{x+t} \\
    &= 1-\delta\ddot{a}_{x+t} - \left (\frac{1}{\ddot{a}_x}-\delta \right) \cdot \ddot{a}_{x+t} \\
    &= 1-\delta\ddot{a}_{x+t} - \frac{\ddot{a}_{x+t}}{\ddot{a}_x} + \delta\ddot{a}_{x+t} \\
    &= 1 - \frac{\ddot{a}_{x+t}}{\ddot{a}_x}
\end{aligned}
$$

### **Case 2: Assurances Only**

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t}V
    &= A_{x+t} - P \ddot{a}_{x+t} \\
    &= A_{x+t} - \frac{A_x}{\ddot{a}_x} \cdot \ddot{a}_{x+t} \\
    &= A_{x+t} - \frac{A_x}{\frac{1-A_x}{d}} \cdot \frac{1-A_{x+t}}{d} \\
    &= A_{x+t} - \frac{A_x}{1-A_x} \cdot (1-A_{x+t}) \\
    &= \frac{A_{x+t} \cdot (1-A_{x}) - A_x(1-A_{x+t})}{1-A_x} \\
    &= \frac{A_{x+t} - A_{x}A_{x+t} - A_x + A_x A_{x+t}}{1-A_x} \\
    &= \frac{A_{x+t} - A_{x}}{1 - A_{x}}
\end{aligned}
$$

### **Case 3: Annuities & Premiums**

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t}V
    &= A_{x+t} - P_x \cdot \ddot{a}_{x+t} \\
    &= \ddot{a}_{x+t} \cdot \left(\frac{A_{x+t}}{\ddot{a}_{x+t}} - P_{x} \right) \\
    &= \ddot{a}_{x+t} \cdot (P_{x+t} - P_{x})
\end{aligned}
$$

### **Case 4: Assurances & Premiums**

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t}V
    &= A_{x+t} - P_x \cdot \ddot{a}_{x+t} \\
    &= A_{x+t} (1 - P_x \cdot \frac{\ddot{a}_{x+t}}{A_{x+t}}) \\
    &= A_{x+t} (1 - P_x \cdot \frac{1}{\frac{A_{x+t}}{\ddot{a}_{x+t}}}) \\
    &= A_{x+t} (1 - \frac{P_x}{P_{x+t}})
\end{aligned}
$$

### **Reserves & Premiums**

The calculation of reserves and premiums both involve the expectation of the random variable $L$:

<center>

| Premiums | Reserves |
| :-: | :-: |
| $E(L)$ given as 0 | $E(L)$ is the target |
| $P$ is the target | $P$ is given |
| Calculated at age $x$ | Calculated at age $x+t$ |

</center>

If **net premium reserves** are calculated at the start of the policy ($t=0$), then following the equivalence principle, the **reserves will be 0**. This is intuitive, as the premiums are set such that they expect to **exactly cover** the losses of the policy.

However, this is not the case for gross premiums. This is because gross premiums include provisions for other cashflows like profit margins which are not considered during the reserve calculation. Thus, gross premiums collect more than enough to cover the expected losses, resulting in a **negative reserve at time 0**.

> Technically speaking, not all gross premiums include profit margins. If they do not, then the gross premium reserve will also be 0.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{0}V^{Net} &= 0 \\
    {}_{0}V^{Gross} &\le 0
\end{aligned}
$$

Note that a newly issued policy for another individual aged $x+t$ uses the exact same $L$ as the reserve, $L_{x+t}$. This is why some of the expressions previously involve $P_{x+t}$, which is the premium of this newly issued policy.

### **Red Herrings**

Premium and Reserve calculations are similar, so it is easy to get them mixed up with each other.

The confusing part is that some questions requires us to compute the premiums ourselves before calculating the reserves. Given how similar the calculations are, this may mistakenly cause us to use the same cashflows for both, when the reserves should be different.

Even if the gross premiums are provided for us, information exclusively used to compute gross premiums may still be provided as a **red herring** to confuse us.

Pay special attention to the following cashflows:

1. **Acquisition Expenses** - Reserves are usually calculated after inception
2. **Profit Margin** - Reserves do not consider profit margin
3. **Premium Frequency** - Reserves use annual premiums; monthly premiums may be provided

### **Recursions**

Following the same logic as assurances and annuities, net premium reserves can also be recursively expressed as a function of itself:

* If the policyholder dies, the insurer would have to pay a **benefit of 1** at the end of the year
* If the policyholder survives, the insurer would have to keep a reserve for future payments
* Premiums are received **REGARDLESS of death or survival** as it was paid at the start of the year

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t}V^{\text{Net}}
    &=
    - P +
    \begin{cases}
        v, & q_{x+t} \\
        v \cdot {}_{t+1}V, & p_{x+t}
    \end{cases} \\
    \\
    \therefore
    {}_{t}V^{\text{Net}}
    &= - P + q_{x+t} \cdot v + p_{x+t} \cdot v \cdot {}_{t+1}V
\end{aligned}
$$

Gross premium reserves are similar as any expenses are always paid at the beginning of the year with premiums:

$$
    {}_{t}V^{\text{Gross}} = (E-G) + q_{x+t} \cdot v + p_{x+t} \cdot v \cdot {}_{t+1}V
$$

## **Expense Reserves**

### **Negative Expense Reserve**

Based on the equivalence principle approach, **on average**, premiums are expected to cover all benefits and expenses.

However, **acquisition expenses** in the first year are often much higher than the renewal expenses, resulting in a positive loss in the first year.

Thus, in all subsequent years, there is a negative loss to gradually recover the positive loss made in the first year. This results in a **negative reserve at the end of the first year**.

A negative reserve implies that expected inflows are larger than outflows, thus the insurer can **treat the policy as an asset** and thus hold less capital overall to cover other liabilities.

To be conservative, regulators do not allow insurers to recognize a negative reserve. Thus, any negative reserves will be **floored at 0**.

## **Interim Reserves**

## **Modified Reserves**

The method and basis for calculating the reserve is based on the prevailing regulation at that time and region. In the US, the basis is to calculate the reserves using the **net premium reserves** method.





Regardless of region, reserves are typically calculated in a **conservative** manner such that the insurer has enough reserves for situations that are worse than their estimates - **higher** than what is expected.

However, insurers do not want to be **too conservative** such that they **hold too much reserves**. This is because reserves can typically only be invested in safe assets, which typically yield lower returns relative to what they would usually invest in. Thus, if too much reserves are held, the insurer incurs an **opportunity cost in investment income**.

In the US, reserves are calculated using **Net Premiums** due to its simplicity. However, this comes at the cost of accuracy, as net premium reserves tend to be **too conservative**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t}v^{\text{Gross}} &= {}_{t}v^{\text{Net}} + {}_{t}v^{\text{Expense}} \\
    {}_{t}v^{\text{Net}} &= {}_{t}v^{\text{Gross}} - \underbrace{{}_{t}v^{\text{Expense}}}_{\text{-ve}} \\
    {}_{t}v^{\text{Net}} &\gt {}_{t}v^{\text{Gross}}
\end{aligned}
$$

In order to overcome this difference, a **modified net premium approach** is used to better reflect actual experience while still retaining the benefits of using net premiums, known as the **Full Preliminary Term Reserves**.



### **Full Preliminary Term**

Assume that the policy has **non-level premiums**:

* Acquisition Premium, $\alpha$
* Renewal Premium, $\beta$

The goal is to calculate a $\beta$ such that the reserve at *time 1* is 0, **replicating the result** under gross premium:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{1}V^{\text{FPT}} &= 0 \\
    A_{x+1} - \beta \ddot{a}_{x+1} &= 0 \\
    \beta &= \frac{A_{x+1}}{\ddot{a}_{x+1}}
\end{aligned}
$$

> Note that for a TA, the duration of the policy would have to decrease by 1 year as well.

Following the equivalence principle, the reserve at time 0 must still be 0, thus $\alpha$ is calculated as the **Single Premium** equal to the expected loss at inception:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{0}V^{\text{FPT}} &= 0 \\
    \alpha &= A_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, the modified reserves at all later times follows the same formula as before, simply using $\beta$ instead:

$$
    {}_{t}V^{\text{FPT}} = A_{x+t} - \beta \ddot{x+t}
$$

Note that $\beta$ can also be thought of as the net premium for a policy that is:

1. Issued one year later; $x+1$
2. One less year passed; $t-1, n-1$

$$
    \therefore {}_{t}V^{\text{FPT}} = {}_{t-1}V^{\text{Net}}_{\text{One year later, one less year}}
