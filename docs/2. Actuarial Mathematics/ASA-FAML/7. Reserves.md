# **Reserves**

## **Overview**

Most life insurance contracts charge **level premiums** - charging the same amount throughout the lifetime of the policy.

When the policyholder is young, the probability of death is small, thus the premiums collected are **larger** than the expected outflow in the year, leading to a **surplus**.

When the policyholder is older, the probability of death is high, thus the premiums collected are **smaller** than the expected outflow in the year, leading to a **deficit**.

Given the inevitable deficit, the surplus in the earlier years cannot be recognized as a profit and are instead **pooled together and safely invested** into an account, from which the deficit in later years will draw from.

!!! Info

    It is a common misconception to think that each policy has its own account. Following this logic, the insurer would not have enough funds to pay an insured who dies shortly after death.

In order to determine the adequacy of the account, insurers will calculate the **size of the expected loss** of ALL policies and compare it against the (hopefully larger) account value.

The expected loss is known as the **Reserve** of the policy because it represents an amount inside the pooled account that is *reserved* for paying the benefits of the policy.

## **Prospective Approach**

There are two approaches to calculate the reserves:

* **Prospective Approach** - Based on Present Values of *future* cashflows
* **Retrospective Approach** - Based on Future Values of past cashflows (Not covered)

Similar to premiums, there are also two types of reserves, depending on what cashflows are being considered:

* **Net Premium Reserves** - Net Premiums and Benefits
* **Gross Premium Reserves** - Gross Premiums, Benefits and Expenses

While this looks similar to premium calculation, note that the Gross *Reserves* do NOT include any other cashflows (EG. Profit Margin). This is intuitive, as reserves should only be to meet **essential cashflows**.

For the purposes of this set of notes, Reserves are calculated at the **beginning of the policy year**:

* **AFTER any year end cashflows** from the previous period (Claims & Claim Expenses)
* **BEFORE any beginning of year cashflows** from the current period (Premiums & Renewal Expenses)

This means that the reserves are the additional amount needed to cover claims from the current year onwards, *including* the current year.

!!! Warning

    It is a common mistake to mix up the timing of the reserve as the **beginning of one policy year is the end of the previous one**.

    * $t-1$: Beginning of year reserve
    * $t$: End of year reserve

    Questions can use either phrasing, so be sure to read very carefully.

Let ${}_{t-1}V$ represent the reserve at the beginning of policy year $t$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t-1}V
    &= E(L_{x+(t-1)}) \\
    &= \text{PV Benefits}_{x+(t-1)} - \text{PV Premiums}_{x+(t-1)}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Tip

    Note that reserves only consider **FUTURE cashflows**. For single premium or deferred products, there is no need to consider the premiums after the payment period is over.

Similar to premiums, we will only define formulas for the **Net Premium Reserves**. They can be simplified into an expression involving only the following, which allows it to be easily calculated in situations where limited information is provided:

1. Annuities only
2. Assurances only
3. Annuities and Premiums
4. Assurance and Premiums

### **Case 1: Annuities Only**

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t-1}V
    &= A_{x+(t-1)} - P \ddot{a}_{x+(t-1)} \\
    &= A_{x+(t-1)} - \frac{A_x}{\ddot{a}_x} \cdot \ddot{a}_{x+(t-1)} \\
    &= (1-\delta\ddot{a}_{x+(t-1)}) - \frac{1-\delta\ddot{a}_{x}}{\ddot{a}_{x}} \cdot \ddot{a}_{x+(t-1)} \\
    &= 1-\delta\ddot{a}_{x+(t-1)} - \left (\frac{1}{\ddot{a}_x}-\delta \right) \cdot \ddot{a}_{x+(t-1)} \\
    &= 1-\delta\ddot{a}_{x+(t-1)} - \frac{\ddot{a}_{x+(t-1)}}{\ddot{a}_x} + \delta\ddot{a}_{x+(t-1)} \\
    &= 1 - \frac{\ddot{a}_{x+(t-1)}}{\ddot{a}_x}
\end{aligned}
$$

### **Case 2: Assurances Only**

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t-1}V
    &= A_{x+(t-1)} - P \ddot{a}_{x+(t-1)} \\
    &= A_{x+(t-1)} - \frac{A_x}{\ddot{a}_x} \cdot \ddot{a}_{x+(t-1)} \\
    &= A_{x+(t-1)} - \frac{A_x}{\frac{1-A_x}{d}} \cdot \frac{1-A_{x+(t-1)}}{d} \\
    &= A_{x+(t-1)} - \frac{A_x}{1-A_x} \cdot (1-A_{x+(t-1)}) \\
    &= \frac{A_{x+(t-1)} \cdot (1-A_{x}) - A_x(1-A_{x+(t-1)})}{1-A_x} \\
    &= \frac{A_{x+(t-1)} - A_{x}A_{x+(t-1)} - A_x + A_x A_{x+(t-1)}}{1-A_x} \\
    &= \frac{A_{x+(t-1)} - A_{x}}{1 - A_{x}}
\end{aligned}
$$

### **Case 3: Annuities & Premiums**

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t}V
    &= A_{x+(t-1)} - P_x \cdot \ddot{a}_{x+(t-1)} \\
    &= \ddot{a}_{x+(t-1)} \cdot \left(\frac{A_{x+(t-1)}}{\ddot{a}_{x+(t-1)}} - P_{x} \right) \\
    &= \ddot{a}_{x+(t-1)} \cdot \left(P_{x+(t-1)} - P_{x} \right)
\end{aligned}
$$

### **Case 4: Assurances & Premiums**

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t}V
    &= A_{x+(t-1)} - P_x \cdot \ddot{a}_{x+(t-1)} \\
    &= A_{x+(t-1)} \left(1 - P_x \cdot \frac{\ddot{a}_{x+(t-1)}}{A_{x+(t-1)}} \right) \\
    &= A_{x+(t-1)} \left(1 - P_x \cdot \frac{1}{\frac{A_{x+(t-1)}}{\ddot{a}_{x+(t-1)}}} \right) \\
    &= A_{x+(t-1)} \left(1 - \frac{P_x}{P_{x+(t-1)}} \right)
\end{aligned}
$$

### **Reserves & Premiums**

The calculation of reserves and premiums both involve the expectation of the random variable $L$:

<center>

| Premiums | Reserves |
| :-: | :-: |
| $E(L)$ given as 0 | $E(L)$ is the target |
| $P$ is the target | $P$ is given |
| Calculated at age $x$ | Calculated at age $x+t$ |

</center>

If **net premium reserves** are calculated at the start of the policy ($t=0$), then following the equivalence principle, the **reserves will be 0**. This is intuitive, as the premiums are set such that they expect to **exactly cover** the losses of the policy.

However, this is not the case for gross premiums. This is because gross premiums include provisions for other cashflows like profit margins which are **not considered during the reserve calculation**. Thus, **gross premiums are more than enough** to cover the expected losses, resulting in a **negative reserve at time 0**.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{0}V^{Net} &= 0 \\
    {}_{0}V^{Gross} &\le 0
\end{aligned}
$$

Note that a newly issued policy for another individual aged $x+t$ uses the exact same $L$ as the reserve, $L_{x+t}$. This is why some of the expressions previously involve $P_{x+t}$, which is the premium of this newly issued policy.

### **Red Herrings**

Premium and Reserve calculations are similar, so it is easy to get them mixed up with each other.

The confusing part is that some questions requires us to compute the premiums ourselves before calculating the reserves. Given how similar the calculations are, this may mistakenly cause us to use the same cashflows for both, when the reserves should be different.

Even if the gross premiums are provided, some information exclusively used to compute gross premiums may still be provided as a **red herring** to intentionally confuse us:

1. **Acquisition Expenses** - Reserves are usually calculated after inception; no need for it
2. **Profit Margin** - Reserves DO NOT consider profit margin
3. **Premium Frequency** - Reserves use annual premiums; monthly premiums may be required or provided

Note that the reverse is also possible, where gross premiums are provided but the question actually requires us to calculate net premiums, which can cause us to mistakenly use the gross premium instead.

### **Recursions**

Following the same logic as assurances and annuities, net premium reserves can also be recursively expressed as a function of itself:

* If the policyholder dies, the insurer would have to pay a **benefit of 1** at the end of the year
* If the policyholder survives, the insurer would have to keep a reserve for future payments
* Premiums are received **REGARDLESS of death or survival** as it was paid at the start of the year

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t}V^{\text{Net}}
    &=
    - P +
    \begin{cases}
        v, & q_{x+t} \\
        v \cdot {}_{t+1}V, & p_{x+t}
    \end{cases} \\
    \\
    \therefore
    {}_{t}V^{\text{Net}}
    &= - P + q_{x+t} \cdot v + p_{x+t} \cdot v \cdot {}_{t+1}V
\end{aligned}
$$

Gross premium reserves are similar as any expenses are always paid at the beginning of the year with premiums:

$$
    {}_{t}V^{\text{Gross}}
    = (E-G) + q_{x+t} \cdot v + p_{x+t} \cdot v \cdot {}_{t+1}V^{\text{Gross}}
$$

#### **Interim Reserves**

The reserve at a fractional age is known as an **Interim Reserve**. Similar to EPVs, it is calculated via recursion:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t}V^{\text{Gross}}
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        v \cdot 1 ,& {}_{s}q_{x+t+s} \\
        v^s \cdot {}_{t+s}V^{\text{Gross}} ,& {}_{s}p_{x+t+s}
    \end{cases} \\
    \\
    \therefore {}_{t}V^{\text{Gross}}
    &= (E-G) + v \cdot q_{x+t+s} + v^s \cdot p_{x+t+s} \cdot {}_{t+s}V^{\text{Gross}}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Warning

    Remember that if the policy is not discrete, then the discounting factor for the benefit needs to be changed.

## **Modified Net Premium Reserves**

The method and basis for calculating the reserve is based on the prevailing regulation at that time and region. In the US, reserves are calculated using **net premiums** due to its simplicity at the cost of some accuracy loss.

However, net premium reserves tend to be **higher than gross premium reserves**. This is due to the negative expense reserves, as the excess expense premiums help to offset the future benefits as well. Since net premiums reserves do not recognize expenses, they do not have this benefit!

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t}v^{\text{Net}} &= {}_{t}v^{\text{Gross}} + \underbrace{{}_{t}v^{\text{Expense}}}_{\text{-ve}} \\
    {}_{t}v^{\text{Net}} &\gt {}_{t}v^{\text{Gross}}
\end{aligned}
$$

This means that insurers are holding **too much reserves** under this valuation basis. This is problematic because reserves can only be invested in low risk assets, which typically have lower returns relative to what the capital would have usually be invested in. This incurs an **opportunity cost in investment income**.

To account for this, US regulators allow for insurers to use a **modified net premium reserve** instead that **implicitly** accounts for expenses while retaining the simplicity of a net premium approach.

### **Expense Reserves**

Similar to expense loadings, we can define a **reserve for just the expenses**, known as the Expense Reserves.

Similarly, it can be determined from **first principles or intuitively** as the difference between the gross and net reserves:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t}V^{\text{Expense}}
    &= \text{EPV(Expenses)} - \text{EPV(Expense Premium)} \\
    &= {}_{t}V^{\text{Gross}} - {}_{t}V^{\text{Net}}
\end{aligned}
$$

The expense reserve is **0 at time 0**. However, the expense reserve is typically **negative** for all other years.

This is because the expense premiums are typically **smaller than the acquisition expenses**, resulting in a positive loss in the first year, known as the **New Business Strain**.

On the other hand, expense premiums are typically **higher than the renewal expenses**, resulting in a negative loss in all subsequent years, recovering the initial loss over time. This is known as the **Deferred Acquisition Cost** as the recovery of the acquisition expenses are deferred to all future years.

At time 1, all future expense premiums will be larger than the corresponding renewal expenses, resulting in a **negative expense reserve** from that time onwards:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{Expense Loading} &\gt \text{Renewal Expense} \\
    \text{EPV(Expense Loaing)} &\gt \text{EPV(Renewal Expense)} \\
    {}_{t}V^{\text{Expense}} < 0
\end{aligned}
$$

### **Full Preliminary Term**

Most methods of calculating modified reserves involve using a **modified premium** to calculate the reserves. In general, these modified premiums are **non-level**, consisting of two (or more) components:

* **First Year Premiums**, $\alpha$
* **Subsequent Premiums**, $\beta$
* Where $\beta \gt P \gt \alpha$

Since $\beta \gt P$, the insurer recognises more premiums for the same amount benefit, resulting in a **smaller reserve**. This allows the insurer to use their capital more productively.

$$
    {}_{t}v^{\text{Modified}} < {}_{t}v^{\text{Net}}
$$

There are many methods of calculating modified reserves, but for the purposes of this exam, we will only be considering the **Full Preliminary Term** method.

The policy can be thought of as being split into two components:

* **One year TA** with **single premiums** of $\alpha$
* The original policy issued **one year later with one less year of coverage** with **recurring premiums** of $\beta$

For the one year TA, following the equivalence principle approach,

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{0}V^{\text{FPT}} &= 0 \\
    \alpha &= A^{1}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}
\end{aligned}
$$

For the original policy issued one year later with **one year less of coverage**, following the equivalence principle approach,

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{1}V^{\text{FPT}} &= 0 \\
    A_{x+1} - \beta \ddot{a}_{x+1} &= 0 \\
    \beta &= \frac{A_{x+1}}{\ddot{a}_{x+1}}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Warning "Special Case: Term & Endowments"

    For Term & Endowment contracts, the *one less year of coverage* must be accounted for:

    $$
        \beta = \frac{A_{x+1:\enclose{actuarial}{n-1}}}{\ddot{a}_{x+1:\enclose{actuarial}{n-1}}}
    $$

Thus, the modified reserves at all later times follows the same formula as before, simply using $\beta$ instead:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t}V^{\text{FPT}}
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        0, & t = 0 \\
        0, & t = 1 \\
        A_{x+t} - \beta \ddot{a}_{x+t}, & t > 1
    \end{cases}
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, the FPT reserves are equivalent to the net premium reserve for a policy that is actually issued one year later with one less year of coverage:

$$
    \therefore {}_{t}V^{\text{FPT}} = {}_{t-1}V^{\text{Net}}_{\text{One year later, one less year}}
$$

!!! Tip

    For WL policies, this is easily calculated using the "shortcut" formulas involving only annuities or assurances.

    Only the assurance/annuity in the denominator needs to be updated to the new starting age one year later, since the ending age remains the same.
