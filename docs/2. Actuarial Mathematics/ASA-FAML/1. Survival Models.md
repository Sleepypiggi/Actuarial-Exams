# **Survival Models**

Survival Models are probability distributions that measure the **time to failure** of an entity, or phrased another way, the **future lifetime** of an entity. In an Actuarial context, it measures the **time to death** of a person.

Since survival models measure *time*, they are denoted by the **continuous random variable** $T_i$, where the subscript represents the **age** of the person being studied.

## **Newborn Lifetime**

The base survival model measures the future lifetime of a newborn (**aged 0**), denoted by the random variable $T_0$.

The **CDF** thus represents the probability that the newborn **dies before age $t$**:

$$
    F_0(t) = P(T_0 \le t)
$$

The **Survival Function** is the **complement of the CDF** and is the probability that the newborn **survives till a certain age $t$**. From a different perspective, it can also be seen as the probability of the newborn **dying AFTER age $t$**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    S_0(t)
    &= P(T_0 \ge t) \\
    &= 1 - P(T_0 \le t) \\
    &= 1 - F_0(t)
\end{aligned}
$$

Note that all humans will **inevitably die**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \lim_{t \to \infty} S_0 (t) = 0 \iff \lim_{t \to \infty} F_0 (t) = 1
\end{aligned}
$$

## **Continuous Lifetime**

The above can be **generalized** for a person aged $x$, denoted by $T_x$. However, the intepretation of the two functions changes slightly.

The CDF instead represents the probability that the person **dies within $t$ years** from age $x$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    F_x(t) &= P(T_x \le t) \\
    T_x &= 1, 2, \dots
\end{aligned}
$$

It can also be written **in terms of the newborn lifetime**. The key is to understand that the newborn is **assumed to survive till age $x$** and then die within the next $t$ years:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    P(T_x \le t)
    &= P(T_0 \le x + t | T_0 > x) \\
    &= \frac{P(x < T_0 < x +t)}{P(T_0 > x)} \\
    &= \frac{P(T_0 < x +t)-P(T_0 < x)}{P(T_0 > x)} \\
    &= \frac{F_0(x+t) - F_0(x)}{S_0(x)}
\end{aligned}
$$

Conversely, the survival function is the probability that the person **survives another $t$ years** or **dies AFTER $t$ years**:

$$
    S_x(t) = P(T_x \ge t)
$$

It can also be written **in terms of the newborn lifetime** following the same logic as above. The newborn is **assumed to survive till age $x$** and then survive another $t$ years:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    P(T_x \ge t)
    &= P(T_0 \ge x + t | T_0 > x) \\
    &= \frac{P(T_0 > x + t)}{P(T_0 > x)} \\
    &= \frac{S_0(x+t)}{S_0(x)}
\end{aligned}
$$

> Note that since the surviving till age $x$ is a **subset** of surviving till age $x+t$, the numerator can be simplified to just surviving till $x+t$.

<!-- Self Made -->
![Survival Function Illustration](Assets/1.%20Survival%20Models.md/Survival%20Function%20Illustration.png){.center}

Note the survival function can thus be re-written as the following:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    S_x(t) &= \frac{S_0(x+t)}{S_0(x)} \\
    S_0(x+t) &= S_0(x)S_x(t) \\
\end{aligned}
$$

The probability of the survival of a newborn till age $x+t$ is the product of:

1. The probability of survival of a newborn till age $x$
2. Given that the newborn survived till age $x$, that they will survive another $t$ years

This can be **generalized** for people of any age to obtain:

$$
    S_x(t+u) = S_x(t) S_{x+t}(u)
$$

### **Deferred Death**

The probability of "deferred" death can also be calculated, whereby the person surives another $t$ years and then **dies within the following $u$ years**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    P(t < T_x < t+u)
    &= P(T_x < t+u) - P(T_x < t) \\
    &= F_x(t+u) - F_x(t) \\
    &= 1 - S_x(t+u) - (1 - S_x(t)) \\
    &= 1 - S_x(t)S_{x+t}(u) - 1 + S_x(t) \\
    &= S_x(t) - S_x(t)S_{x+t}(u) \\
    &= S_x(t)(1-S_{x+t}(u)) \\
    &= S_x(t)F_{x+t}(u)
\end{aligned}
$$

> It is important to remember to "update" the starting age of the second term to the "new age".

### **Force of Mortality**

The **Force of Mortality** is the probability of dying *instantly*; in an **infinitely small unit of time** (normalized by unit time):

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \mu_(x)
    &= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{P(T_x < h)}{h} \\
    &= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{1 - S_x(h)}{h} \\
    &= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{1 - (\frac{S_0(x+h)}{S_0(x)})}{h} \\
    &= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{S_0(x) - S_0(x+h)}{S_0(x)h} \\
    &= \frac{1}{S_0(x)} \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{S_0(x) - S_0(x+h)}{h} \\
    &= - \frac{1}{S_0(x)} \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{S_0(x+h) - S_0(x)}{h} \\
    &= - \frac{1}{S_0(x)} S'_0(x) \\
    &= - \frac{S'_0(x)}{S_0(x)}
\end{aligned}
$$

Since $S_0(x)$ is the complement of $F_0(x)$, the derivative of the survival function can be written in terms of the PDF of the future lifetime:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    f_0(x)
    &= \frac{d}{dx} F_0(x) \\
    &= \frac{d}{dx} (1-S_0(x)) \\
    &= -S'_0(x)
\end{aligned}
$$

The force of mortality can be rewritten as the following:

$$
    \mu_x = \frac{f_0(x)}{S_0(x)}
$$

Thus, the force of mortality can also be intepreted as the **CONDITIONAL probability distribution** of death for a person aged $x$, *assuming* that the person survives till age $x$.

> $f_0(x)$ is UNCONDITIONAL distribution of the future lifetime as it does not assume the individual lives to any age.

#### **Alternative Death Function**

More generally, the force of mortality can be rewritten as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \mu_x &= \frac{f_0(x)}{S_0(x)} \\
    \mu_{x+t} &= \frac{f_x(t)}{S_x(t)} \\
    f_x(t) &= S_x(t)\mu_{x+t} \\
    F_x(t) &= \int_0^t S_x(t)\mu_{x+t}
\end{aligned}
$$

The probability of death in an interval is the SUM of the product of the probability of surviving till a given age and then dying in an infinitely small time afterwards. The sum of all the infinitely small time periods is equal to the given time interval.

Following this definition, for **extremely small time intervals**, the force of mortality can be used to *approximate* the probability of death in that interval:

$$
    P(T_x < h) \approx h * \mu_{x}
$$

#### **Alternative Survival Function**

More generally, the force of mortality can be rewritten as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \mu_(x) &= - \frac{S'_0(x)}{S_0(x)} \\
    \mu_{x + t} &= \frac{-S'_x(t)}{S_x(t)} \\
    \mu_{x + t} &= - \frac{d}{dt} (\ln S_x(t)) \\
    \ln S_x(t) &= - \int_{0}^{t} \mu_{x + t} \\
    S_x(t) &= e ^ {- \int_{0}^{t} \mu_{x + t}} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, if $mu_x$ is known for all ages (x), then the survival probabilites for any age can be calculated from it. In other words, the **distribution of $T_x$ can be determined from the force of mortality**.

### **Continuous Expectation**

**Life Expectancy** measures the number of years a person is *expected* to live. It most commonly used with respect to newborns. It is calculated as the **Expectation** of the distribution of future lifetime:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \mathring{e}_x
    &= E(T_x) \\
    &= \int_{0}^{t} t f_x(t) \\
    &= - \int_{0}^{t} t S_x(t)
\end{aligned}
$$

Let $u=t$ and $dv=S'_x(t)$. Through integration by parts,

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \mathring{e}_x
    &= -\left(uv - \int_{0}^{\infty} v du\right) \\
    &= -\left(\Bigl[tS_x(t)\Bigr]_0^\infty - \int_0^\infty S_x(t)\right) \\
    &= \int_0^\infty S_x(t)
\end{aligned}
$$

> Recall that $[-t * S_x(t)]^{\infty}_0$ is 0 as the probability of living forever is 0.

More formally, the above is known as the **Complete Expectation of Life**. If the expectation was calculated over a specified term instead of indefinitely, then the result is known as the **Term Expectation of Life**.

<!--
$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \mathring{e} _x - \mathring{e} _{x+1} &= \int_0^\infty S_x(t) dt - \int_0^\infty S _{x+1}(t) dt \\
    &= \int_0^\infty S_x(t) dt - \int_0^\infty \frac{S _{x}(t+1)}{S_x(1)} dt \\
    &= \int_0^\infty S_x(t) dt - \int_1^\infty \frac{S _{x}(t)}{S_x(1)} dt \\
    &\leq \int_0^\infty S_x(t) dt - \int_1^\infty S _{x}(t) dt \\
    &= \int_0^1 S_x(t) dt \\
    &\leq \int_0^1 1 dt = 1.
  \end{aligned}
$$
-->

### **Continuous Variance**

The second moment can be calculated in a similar fashion:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E(T^2_x)
    &= \int_{0}^{\infty} t^2 f_x(t) \\
    &= -\left(\Bigl[t^2 S_x(t)\Bigr]_0^\infty - \int_{0}^{\infty} 2tS_x(t) \right) \\
    &= \int_{0}^{\infty} 2tS_x(t)
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, the **Variance** of the future lifetime about the Expectation is the following:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    Var(T_x)
    &= E(T^2_x) - [E(T_x)]^2 \\
    &= \int_{0}^{\infty} 2tS_x(t) - \left(\int_0^\infty S_x(t) \right)^2
\end{aligned}
$$

### **Actuarial Notation**

Given how often these expressions are used, they are often abbreviated using the **International Actuarial Notation**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t}p_{x} &= S_x(t) \\
    {}_{t}q_{x} &= F_x(t) \\
    {}_{t}q_{x} + {}_{t}p_{x} &= 1
\end{aligned}
$$

> If $t=1$, it is omitted; EG. ${}_{1}q_{x} = q_{x}$.

Deferred Deaths are expressed using the pipe symbol:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t|u}q_{x}
    &= S_x(t)F_{x+t}(u) \\
    &= {}_{t}p_{x} * {}_{u}q_{x+t}
\end{aligned}
$$

## **Discrete Lifetime**

If only the **integer components** of the future lifetime are considered, then it becomes a discrete distribution known as the **Curtate Future Lifetime** of the person.

It is denoted by the random variable $K_x$, which is a truncated version of $T_x$. Formally, it is known as a **Floor Function**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    K_x &= \lfloor T_x \rfloor \\
    K_x &= 0, 1, \dots
\end{aligned}
$$

The intepretation of the probability is slightly different. $P(K_x = k)$ represents the probability of **living $k$ years**, but dying within the next year. In other words, death will occur between **age $x+k$ (inclusive) and $k+1$ (Exclusive)**.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    P(K_x = k)
    &= P(x+k \le T_0 < x+k+1) \\
    &= P(k \le T_x < k+1) \\
    &= P(T_x < k+1) - P(T_x \le k) \\
    &= F_x(k+1) - F_x(k) \\
    &= S_x(k) - S_x(k+1) \\
    &= S_x(k) - S_x(k) * S_{x+k}(1) \\
    &= S_x(k) (1 - S_{x+k}(1)) \\
    &= S_x(k) F_{x+k}(1) \\
    &= {} {}_{k}p_{x} {}_{}q_{x + k} \\
    &= {}_{k|}q_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

<!-- Self Made -->
![Curtate Death Illustration](Assets/1.%20Survival%20Models.md/Curtate%20Death%20Illustration.png){.center}

Based on the above explanation, it is important to note that $K_x$ **starts from 0**. It represents the **probability of dying in the current year**.


### **Discrete Expectation**

Similarly, the Expected Curtate Lifetime is the expectation of $K_x$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    e_x
    &=(K_x) \\
    &= \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} k ({}_{k}p_{x} - {}_{k+1}p_{x}) \\
    &= 1 ({}_{1}p_{x} - {}_{2}p_{x}) + 2 ({}_{2}p_{x} - {}_{3}p_{x}) + 3 ({}_{3}p_{x} - {}_{4}p_{x}) + ... \\
    &= {}_{1}p_{x} - {}_{2}p_{x} + 2{}_{2}p_{x} - 2{}_{3}p_{x} + 3 {}_{3}p_{x} - 3 {}_{4}p_{x} \\
    &= {}_{1}p_{x} + 2{}_{2}p_{x} + 3 {}_{3}p_{x} + ... \\
    &= \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} {}_{k}p_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

If the expectation for one period is known, the expectation for all other periods can be calculated recurively:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    e _{x+1}
    &= \sum _{k=1}^{\infty} {}_{k}p_{x+1} \\
    &= \sum _{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{{}_{k+1}p_{x}}{{}_{1}p_{x}} \\
    &= \frac{1}{p_x}\cdot \left(\sum _{k=1}^{\infty} {}_{k}p_{x} - {}_{1}p_{x} \right)\\
    &= \frac{1}{p_x}(e_x - {}_{1}p_{x}) \\
    &= \frac{e_x}{p_x} - 1
  \end{aligned}
$$

Generally speaking, the discrete expectation can be thought of as an *approximation* of the continuous one. Mathematically speaking, the continuous one calculates the area under the survival function, which the discrete version approximates using rectangles.

Since the rectangles under approximate the area,

$$
    e_x < \mathring{e}_x
$$

<!-- Obtained from Libretexts -->
![Rectangle Area](Assets/1.%20Survival%20Models.md/Rectangle%20Area.png){.center}

If it is asssumed that the lifetime variable is **uniformly distributed within the year** (which is a fair assumption because the chance of dying in December is not much larger than dying in January), then it can be shown that:

$$
    \mathring{e}_x \approx e_x + \frac{1}{2}
$$

> Note that the assumption falls off for older years as the difference in mortality between the end of year and the beginning of year is larger for older lives than for younger lives.

### **Discrete Variance**

The second moment can be calculated in a similar fashion:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E(K^2_x)
    &= \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} k^2 ({}_{k}p_{x} - {}_{k+1}p_{x}) \\
    &= 1 ({}_{1}p_{x} - {}_{2}p_{x}) + 4 ({}_{2}p_{x} - {}_{3}p_{x}) + 9 ({}_{3}p_{x} - {}_{4}p_{x}) + ... \\
    &= {}_{1}p_{x} - {}_{2}p_{x} + 4{}_{2}p_{x} - 4{}_{3}p_{x} + 9 {}_{3}p_{x} - 9 {}_{4}p_{x} \\
    &= {}_{1}p_{x} + 3{}_{2}p_{x} + 5 {}_{3}p_{x} + ... \\
    &= \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} (2k-1) {}_{k}p_{x} \\
    &= \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} 2k{}_{k}p_{x} - {}_{k}p_{x} \\
    &= \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} 2k{}_{k}p_{x} - \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} {}_{k}p_{x} \\
    &= 2 \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} k{}_{k}p_{x} - e_x
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, the variance can be calculated as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    Var(K_x)
    &= E(K_x^2) - [E(K_x)]^2 \\
    &= 2 \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} k{}_{k}p_{x} - e_x - (e_x)^2
\end{aligned}
$$

## **Parametric Survival Models**

Given the importance of $\mu_x$, several mathematical functions have been made to describe the force of mortality, known as a **Parametric Survival Model**.

### **De Moivre Model**

### **Gompertz Model**

Refer to youtube video for proof

### **Makeham Model**

### **Gompertz Makeham Distributions**

**Gompertz Law** law suggests that mortality **increases exponentially with age**:

$$
\mu_x = Bc^x
$$

$B$ represents the **initial level** of mortality while $c$ represents the **rate of change** of mortality
