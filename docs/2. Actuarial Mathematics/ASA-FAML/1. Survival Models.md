# **Survival Models**

Survival Models are probability distributions that measure the **time to failure** of an entity, or phrased another way, the **future lifetime** of an entity. In an Actuarial context, it measures the **time to death** of a person.

Since survival models measure *time*, they are denoted by the **continuous random variable** $T_i$, where the subscript represents the **age** of the person being studied.

## **Newborn Lifetime**

The base survival model measures the future lifetime of a newborn (**aged 0**), denoted by the random variable $T_0$.

The **CDF** thus represents the probability that the newborn **dies before age $t$**:

$$
    F_0(t) = P(T_0 \le t)
$$

> The PDF is represented by $f(x)$.

The **Survival Function** is the **complement of the CDF** and is the probability that the newborn **survives till a certain age $t$**. From a different perspective, it can also be seen as the probability of the newborn **dying AFTER age $t$**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    S_0(t)
    &= P(T_0 \ge t) \\
    &= 1 - P(T_0 \le t) \\
    &= 1 - F_0(t)
\end{aligned}
$$

Note that all humans will **inevitably die**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \lim_{t \to \infty} S_0 (t) &= 0 \\
    \lim_{t \to \infty} F_0 (t) &= 1
\end{aligned}
$$

## **Continuous Lifetime**

The above can be **generalized** for a person aged $x$, denoted by $T_x$. However, the intepretation of the two functions changes slightly.

The CDF instead represents the probability that the person **dies within $t$ years** from age $x$:

$$
F_x(t) = P(T_x \le t)
$$

It can also be written **in terms of the newborn lifetime**. The key is to understand that the newborn is **assumed to survive till age $x$** and then die within the next $t$ years:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    P(T_x \le t)
    &= P(T_0 \le x + t | T_0 > x) \\
    &= \frac{P(x < T_0 < x +t)}{P(T_0 > x)} \\
    &= \frac{P(T_0 < x +t)-P(T_0 < x)}{P(T_0 > x)} \\
    &= \frac{F_0(x+t) - F_0(x)}{S_0(x)}
\end{aligned}
$$

Conversely, the survival function is the probability that the person **survives another $t$ years** or **dies AFTER $t$ years**:

$$
    S_x(t) = P(T_x \ge t)
$$

It can also be written **in terms of the newborn lifetime** following the same logic as above. The newborn is **assumed to survive till age $x$** and then survive another $t$ years:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    P(T_x \ge t)
    &= P(T_0 \ge x + t | T_0 > x) \\
    &= \frac{P(T_0 > x + t)}{P(T_0 > x)} \\
    &= \frac{S_0(x+t)}{S_0(x)}
\end{aligned}
$$

> Note that since the surviving till age $x$ is a **subset** of surviving till age $x+t$, the numerator can be simplified to just surviving till $x+t$.

<!-- Self Made -->
![Survival Function Illustration](Assets/1.%20Survival%20Models.md/Survival%20Function%20Illustration.png){.center}

Note the survival function can thus be re-written as the following:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    S_x(t) &= \frac{S_0(x+t)}{S_0(x)} \\
    S_0(x+t) &= S_0(x)S_x(t) \\
\end{aligned}
$$

The probability of the survival of a newborn till age $x+t$ is the product of:

1. The probability of survival of a newborn till age $x$
2. Given that the newborn survived till age $x$, that they will survive another $t$ years

This can be **generalized** for people of any age to obtain:

$$
    S_x(t+u) = S_x(t) S_{x+t}(u)
$$

### **Deferred Death**

The probability of "deferred" death can also be calculated, whereby the person surives another $t$ years and then **dies within the following $u$ years**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    P(t < T_x < t+u)
    &= P(T_x < t+u) - P(T_x < t) \\
    &= F_x(t+u) - F_x(t) \\
    &= 1 - S_x(t+u) - (1 - S_x(t)) \\
    &= 1 - S_x(t)S_{x+t}(u) - 1 + S_x(t) \\
    &= S_x(t) - S_x(t)S_{x+t}(u) \\
    &= S_x(t)(1-S_{x+t}(u)) \\
    &= S_x(t)F_{x+t}(u)
\end{aligned}
$$

> It is important to remember to "update" the starting age of the second term to the "new age".

### **Force of Mortality**

The **Force of Mortality** is the probability of dying *instantly*; in an **infinitely small unit of time** (normalized by unit time):

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \mu_(x)
    &= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{P(T_x < h)}{h} \\
    &= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{1 - S_x(h)}{h} \\
    &= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{1 - (\frac{S_0(x+h)}{S_0(x)})}{h} \\
    &= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{S_0(x) - S_0(x+h)}{S_0(x)h} \\
    &= \frac{1}{S_0(x)} \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{S_0(x) - S_0(x+h)}{h} \\
    &= - \frac{1}{S_0(x)} \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{S_0(x+h) - S_0(x)}{h} \\
    &= - \frac{1}{S_0(x)} S'_0(x) \\
    &= - \frac{S'_0(x)}{S_0(x)}
\end{aligned}
$$

Since $S_0(x)$ is the complement of $F_0(x)$, the derivative of the survival function can be written in terms of the PDF of the future lifetime:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    f_0(x)
    &= \frac{d}{dx} F_0(x) \\
    &= \frac{d}{dx} (1-S_0(x)) \\
    &= -S'_0(x)
\end{aligned}
$$

The force of mortality can be rewritten as the following:

$$
    \mu_x = \frac{f_0(x)}{S_0(x)}
$$

Thus, the force of mortality can also be intepreted as the **CONDITIONAL probability distribution** of death for a person aged $x$, *assuming* that the person survives till age $x$.

> $f_0(x)$ is UNCONDITIONAL distribution of the future lifetime as it does not assume the individual lives to any age.

#### **Alternative Death Function**

More generally, the force of mortality can be rewritten as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \mu_x &= \frac{f_0(x)}{S_0(x)} \\
    \mu_{x+t} &= \frac{f_x(t)}{S_x(t)} \\
    f_x(t) &= S_x(t)\mu_{x+t} \\
    F_x(t) &= \int_0^t S_x(t)\mu_{x+t}
\end{aligned}
$$

The probability of death in an interval is the SUM of the product of the probability of surviving till a given age and then dying in an infinitely small time afterwards. The sum of all the infinitely small time periods is equal to the given time interval.

Following this definition, for **extremely small time intervals**, the force of mortality can be used to *approximate* the probability of death in that interval:

$$
    P(T_x < h) \approx h * \mu_{x}
$$

#### **Alternative Survival Function**

More generally, the force of mortality can be rewritten as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \mu_(x) &= - \frac{S'_0(x)}{S_0(x)} \\
    \mu_{x + t} &= \frac{-S'_x(t)}{S_x(t)} \\ 
    \mu_{x + t} &= - \frac{d}{dt} (\ln S_x(t)) \\
    \ln S_x(t) &= - \int_{0}^{t} \mu_{x + t} \\
    S_x(t) &= e ^ {- \int_{0}^{t} \mu_{x + t}} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}

{}_{t}p_{x} &= e ^ {- \int_{0}^{t} \mu_{x + t}}
\end{aligned}
$$

### **Mortality Laws**

### **Actuarial Notation**

Given how often these expressions are used, they are often abbreviated using the **International Actuarial Notation**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t}p_{x} &= S_x(t) \\
    {}_{t}q_{x} &= F_x(t) \\
    {}_{t}q_{x} + {}_{t}p_{x} &= 1
\end{aligned}
$$

> If $t=1$, it is omitted; EG. ${}_{1}q_{x} = q_{x}$.

Deferred Deaths are expressed using the pipe symbol:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t|u}q_{x}
    &= S_x(t)F_{x+t}(u) \\
    &= {}_{t}p_{x} * {}_{u}q_{x+t}
\end{aligned}
$$

Combining both the above,



### **Expectation and Variance**

The Expectation of the Future Lifetime is known as the **Life Expectancy** of the individual.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathring{e}_x
&= E(T_x) \\
&= \int_{0}^{t} t * {}_{t}p_{x} * \mu_{x+t} \\
&= \int_{0}^{t} t * -S'_x(t) \\
&= [-t * {}_{t}p_{x}]^{\infty}_0 + \int_{0}^{t} {}_{t}p_{x} \\
&= \int_{0}^{t} {}_{t}p_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

> Note that $[-t * {}_{t}p_{x}]^{\infty}_0$ is always 0 as the probability of living forever is 0.

Unfortunately, there is **no simplification** to be made for the Variance of the future lifetime:

$$
\begin{aligned}
Var(T_x)
&= E(T^2_x) - [E(T_x)]^2 \\
&= \int_{0}^{t} t^2 * {}_{t}p_{x} * \mu_{x+t} - [\mathring{e}_x]^2
\end{aligned}
$$

## **Discrete Distribution**

If the lifetime of the person is discrete instead, then it is known as the **Curtate Future Lifetime** of the person. It is denoted by $K_x$.

The intepretation is slightly different - $P(K_x = k)$ represents the probability of the dying between **age k (inclusive) and k+1 (Exclusive)**.

This can be expressed in continuous terms as:

$$
P(K_x = k) = P(k < T_x < K + 1) = {}_{k}p_{x} * q_{x+k}
$$

<!-- Start from 0, end at n-1 
A continuous lifetime can be converted into a discrete one by **truncating** it - removing the decimal points.
K_X = [t_x}-->

### **Expectation & Variance**

Similarly, the expected future lifetime can be calcualated:

$$
\begin{aligned}
e_x
&=(K_x) \\
&= \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} k * {}_{k}p_{x} * q_{x+k} \\
&= {}_{1}p_{x} * q_{x+1} + 2{}_{2}p_{x} * q_{x+2} + 3{}_{3}p_{x} * q_{x+3} + ... \\
&= ({}_{1}p_{x} * q_{x+1} + {}_{2}p_{x} * q_{x+2} + ...) + ({}_{2}p_{x} * q_{x+2} + {}_{3}p_{x} * q_{x+3} + ...) + ({}_{3}p_{x} * q_{x+3} + {}_{4}p_{x} * q_{x+4} + ...) \\
&= \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \sum_{j=k}^{\infty} {}_{j}p_{x}* q_{x+j} \\
&= \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} {}_{k}p_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

<!-- Insert comments about proof -->

Unfortunately, there is **no simplification** to be made for the Variance:

$$
\begin{aligned}
Var(K_x)
&= E(K_x^2) - [E(K_x)]^2 \\
&= \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} (k^2 {}_{k}p_{x} * q_{x+k}) - (e_x)^2
\end{aligned}
$$
