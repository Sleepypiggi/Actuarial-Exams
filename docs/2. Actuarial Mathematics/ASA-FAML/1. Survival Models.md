# **Survival Models**

This section assumes some basic knowledge on **Probability Theory**, which can be found under another set of notes covering a [Review of Probability Theory](../ASA-FAMS/1. Review of Probability Theory.md).

## **Overview**

Survival Models are probability distributions that measure the **time to failure** of an entity.

In an actuarial context, it measures the **time to death** of a person. From another perspective, it also measures the **future lifetime** of that person.

!!! Note

    If someone is going to die in 5 years, then the person only has 5 years left to live (future lifetime).

Intuitively, the distribution depends heavily on the age of the person, which is denoted using $(x)$, which denotes a **life aged $x$**.

## **Continuous Lifetime**

The distribution of the time to death (**in years**) is represented using the **Continuous Random Variable** $T_{x}$, where $x$ represents the age of the person.

!!! Note

    Although we often use integer values for time, it can be expressed in continuous form as well:

    * **1 Year** = 12 Months
    * **0.5 Years** =  6 Months
    * **0.541 Years** = 6 Months & 15 Days

Since $T_{x}$ represents the time to death, a person aged $x$ will live for another $T_{x}$ years and then die before age $x + T_{x}$:

![Continuous RV](Assets/1.%20Survival%20Models.md/Continuous%20RV.png){.center}

The probability that the person **dies DURING the next $t$ years before age $x+t$** is given by the **CDF** of the distribution:

$$
    F_{x}(t) = P(T_{x} \le t)
$$

!!! Note

    The implicit assumption is that the person aged $x$ **just turned age $x$** (on their birthday).

    Thus, dying within the next $t$ years means that they will not live to turn age $x+t$.

<!-- Obtained from Coaching Actuaries -->
![CDF Timeline](Assets/1.%20Survival%20Models.md/CDF%20Timeline.png){.center}

The complement of the CDF is the probability that the person **dies AFTER the next $t$ years**. From another perspective, this also means that the person **survives the next $t$ years to age $x+t$**, which is why it is known as the **Survival Function**.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    S_{x}(t)
    &= P(T_{x} \gt t) \\
    &= 1 - P(T_{x} \lt t) \\
    &= 1 - F_{x}(t) \\
\end{aligned}
$$

![Survival Timeline](Assets/1.%20Survival%20Models.md/Survival%20Timeline.png){.center}

Since they are complements of one another, they share similar properties:

\ltcenter\gt

| CDF | Survival Function | Intuition |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| $F_{x}(0) = 0$ | $S_{x}(0) = 1$ | Humans are currently alive |
| $F_{x}(\infty) = 1$ | $S_{x}(\infty) = 0$ | Humans will inevitably die |
| Non-decreasing function | Non-increasing function | Probability of death increases with age |

\lt/center\gt

!!! Warning

    The first property is hard to intepret. The probability that a life aged $x$ dies within 0 years before age $x+0$ must be 0, since the person is *already* aged $x$.

The above two can also be *combined* into the probability of **surviving $u$ years** till age $x+u$ and then **dying within the following $t$ years** before age $x+u+t$, known as the **Probability of Deferred Death**.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    P(u \lt T_x \lt t+u)
    &= P(T_x \lt t+u) - P(T_x \lt u) \\
    &= [1 - P(T_x \gt t+u)] - [1 - P(T_x \gt u)] \\
    &= P(T_x \gt u) - P(T_x \gt t+u) \\
    &= P(T_x \gt u) - P(T_x \gt u) \cdot P(T_{x+u} \gt t) \\
    &= P(T_x \gt u) [1 - P(T_{x+u} \gt t)] \\
    &= P(T_x \gt u) \cdot P(T_{x+u} \lt t) \\
    &= S_{x}(u) \cdot F_{x+t}(t)
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Warning

    Remember that the second term reflects the **"new" age** of the person after surviving $u$ years till age $x+u$.

![Deferred Death Timeline](Assets/1.%20Survival%20Models.md/Deferred%20Death%20Timeline.png){.center}

Using **Only Survival Functions**, it is represented as the probability that the person **survives $u$ years but does not survive past $u+t$ years**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    P(u \lt T_x \lt t+u)
    &= P(T_x \lt t+u) - P(T_x \lt u) \\
    &= [1 - P(T_x \gt t+u)] - [1 - P(T_x \gt u)] \\
    &= P(T_x \gt u) - P(T_x \gt t+u) \\
    &= S_{x}(u) - S_{x}(t+u)
\end{aligned}
$$

<!-- Obtained from Coaching Actuaries -->
![Deferred Death only CDF](Assets/1.%20Survival%20Models.md/Deferred%20Death%20only%20Survival.png){.center}

Using **Only Death Functions**, it is represented as the probability of dying within $u+t$ years but NOT $u$ years:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    P(u \lt T_{x} \lt u+t)
    &= P(T_x \lt u+t) - P(T_x \lt u) \\
    &= F_{x} (u+t) - F_{x}(u)
\end{aligned}
$$

![Deferred Death only CDF](Assets/1.%20Survival%20Models.md/Deferred%20Death%20only%20CDF.png){.center}

!!! Tip

    An easy way to remember the different formulations (especially the ones involving only death or survival) is to **visualize** them, as seen above.

    Notice that all the **red lines NOT on the timeline** represents the time where the **person is alive** under that probability. Find the combination of probabilities that results in a **difference during the period we want the policyholder to die**.

### **Newborn Lifetime**

Note that one implicit assumption made so far is that the person has **already survived till age $x$**.

In order to further analyze this, we must consider a special case of the distribution for a **newborn aged 0**, represented by $T_{0}$.

The future lifetime variable is essentially **conditioned** on the newborn having survived $x$ years, then dying within the following $t$ years before age $x+t$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    T_{x} &= T_{0} - x \mid T_{0} \gt x \\
    \\
    P(T_x \le t)
    &= P(T_0 \le x + t \mid T_0 \gt x) \\
    &= \frac{P(x \lt T_0 \lt x +t)}{P(T_0 \gt x)} \\
    &= \frac{P(T_0 \lt x +t)-P(T_0 \lt x)}{P(T_0 \gt x)}
\end{aligned}
$$

<!-- Self Made -->
![CDF Illustration](Assets/1.%20Survival%20Models.md/CDF%20Illustration.png){.center}

When written in terms of the survival function, it can be simplified even further:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    P(T_x \ge t)
    &= P(T_0 \ge x + t | T_0 \gt x) \\
    &= \frac{P(T_0 \gt x + t)}{P(T_0 \gt x)} \\
    &= \frac{S_0(x+t)}{S_0(x)}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Note

    Since the surviving till age $x$ is a **subset** of surviving till age $x+t$, the numerator can be simplified to just the probability of surviving till age $x+t$.

This leads to the **Multiplication Rule** of survival probabilities:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    S_x(t) &= \frac{S_0(x+t)}{S_0(x)} \\
    S_0(x+t) &= S_0(x)S_x(t) \\
    \\
    \therefore S_x(t+u) &= S_x(u) S_{x+u}(t)
\end{aligned}
$$

The survival probability can be decomposed into two components:

1. The probability of a person surviving $u$ years
2. The **conditional probability** of person who has survived $u$ years (new age) surviving *another* $t$ years

!!! Warning

    This result **ONLY applies to the survival probabilities**!

### **Actuarial Notation**

Given how often the survival function is used, they are often abbreviated using the **International Actuarial Notation**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    P(T_{x} \lt t) &= {}_{t}q_{x} \\
    P(T_{x} \gt u) &= {}_{t}p_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Note

    If $t=1$, it is omitted - EG. ${}_{1}q_{x} = q_{x}$.

Deferred Deaths are expressed using the **pipe symbol**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    P(u \lt T_{x} \lt t+u)
    &= {}_{u \mid t}q_{x} \\
    &= {}_{u}p_{x} \cdot {}_{t}q_{x+t} \\
    &= {}_{u}p_{x} - {}_{u+t}p_{x} \\
    &= {}_{t+u}q_{x} - {}_{u}q_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

Other key results:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t+u}p_{x} &= {}_{u}p_{x} \cdot {}_{t}p_{x+u} \\
    {}_{t}p_{x} &= \sum^{t}_{u = t} {}_{u|}q_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

## **Discrete Lifetime**

Similarly, the distribution of the time to death (**in years**) can also be represented using a **Discrete Random Variable** $K_{x}$, where $x$ represents the age of the person.

It is also known as the **Curtate Future Lifetime** as it only contains the **integer components** of the continuous future lifetime.

!!! Info

    The definition of Curtate is "shortened"; it represents how the continuous distribution has been reduced to just its integer components.

    Another way to remember is that $K$ stands for **Kurtate**.

Mathematically, it is represented as a continuous lifetime variable that has been **floored**:

$$
    K_x = \lfloor T_x \rfloor
$$

The intepretation of $K_{x}$ has changed slightly - A person aged $x$ will live for another $K_x$ **FULL years** and then die before age $x + K_{x} + 1$:

<!-- Obtained from Coaching Actuaries -->
![Curate Timeline](Assets/1.%20Survival%20Models.md/Curtate%20Timeline.png){.center}

!!! Warning

    It is a very common mistake to misintepret $K_x$, thus consider the following examples:

    A person aged $x$ **dies within the same year**. They have **lived for 0 full years** since turning $x$, thus $K_x = 0$.

    A person aged $x$ lives till their $x+1$ birthday but dies in that year. They have **lived for 1 full year** since turning $x$, thus $K_x = 1$.

$K_x = k$ can also be intepreted more intuitively as the **deferred probability of living $k$ years and then dying the following year**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    P(K_x = k)
    &= P(k \le T_x \lt k+1) \\
    &= P(T_x \lt k+1) - P(T_x \le k) \\
    &= {}_{k+1}q_{x} - {}_{k}q_{x} \\
    &= {}_{k}p_{x} - {}_{k+1}p_{x} \\
    &= {}_{k}p_{x} - {}_{k}p_{x} \cdot {}_{1}p_{x+k} \\
    &= {}_{k}p_{x} \cdot (1 - {}_{1}p_{x+k}) \\
    &= {}_{k}p_{x} \cdot {}_{1}q_{x+k} \\
    &= {}_{k \mid 1}q_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Tip

    Recall that the probability of deferred death can be represented in three different ways, thus the PDF may take on different formulations:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        {}_{u \mid 1}q_{x}
        &= {}_{u}p_{x} \cdot {}_{}q_{x+t} \\
        &= {}_{u}p_{x} - {}_{u+1}p_{x} \\
        &= {}_{u+1}q_{x} - {}_{u}q_{x}
    \end{aligned}
    $$

## **Force of Mortality**

${}_{h}q_{x}$ is the probability of dying within $h$ years:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{h}q_{x}
    &= 1 - {}_{h}q_{x} \\
    &= 1 - \frac{S_0(x+h)}{S_0(x)} \\
    &= \frac{S_0(x) - S_0(x+h)}{S_0(x)}
\end{aligned}
$$

The **Force of Mortality** $(\mu_{x})$ is the probability that (x) dies within an **infinitely small $h$**; in other words, the **probability of dying instantly**.

We consider the rate of death per unit time (this is NOT a probability!):

$$
    \frac{{}_{h}q_{x}}{h} = \frac{S_0(x) - S_0(x+h)}{h \cdot S_0(x)}
$$

!!! Note

    The proof uses the first principles of differentiation, which measures the rate of change of $y$ over an infinitely small unit of $x$, which is why the rate of death had to be considered.

As the period of time becomes infinitely small,

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \mu_{x}
    &= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{S_0(x) - S_0(x+h)}{S_0(x)h} \\
    &= \frac{1}{S_0(x)} \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{S_0(x) - S_0(x+h)}{h} \\
    &= - \frac{1}{S_0(x)} \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{S_0(x+h) - S_0(x)}{h} \\
    &= - \frac{1}{S_0(x)} \cdot \left(\frac{d}{dx} S_0(x) \right) \\
    &= - \frac{S'_0(x)}{S_0(x)} \\
    &= - \frac{d}{dx} \ln S_0(x)
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Note

    Since the force of mortality represents the instantaneous rate of death,
    for **extremely small time intervals**, it can be used to *approximate* the probability of death in that interval:

    $$
        P(T_x \lt h) \approx h * \mu_{x}
    $$

Using the PDF of the newborn distribution, the force of mortality can be rewritten accordingly:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    f_0(x)
    &= \frac{d}{dx} F_0(x) \\
    &= \frac{d}{dx} (1 - S_0(x)) \\
    &= -S'_0(x) \\
    \\
    \therefore \mu_{x} &= \frac{f_0(x)}{S_0(x)}
\end{aligned}
$$

Loosely speaking, it represents the probability of a **newborn living till age $x$ and then dying instantly**.

### **Generalization**

The force of mortality is currently defined using the newborn distribution:

$$
    \mu_{y} = - \frac{\frac{d}{dy} S_0(y)}{S_0(y)}
$$

For (x), $y = x + t$, where t is a random:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    dy
    &= dx + dt \\
    &= 0 + dt \\
    &= dt \\
    \\
    \therefore \mu_{x+t}
    &= - \frac{\frac{d}{dt} S_0(x+t)}{S_0(x+t)} \\
    &= - \frac{d}{dt} \ln S_0(x+t)
\end{aligned}
$$

Since integration is the reverse of differentiation,

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \int^{n}_{0} \frac{d}{dt} \ln S_0(x+t) &= - \int^{n}_{0} \mu_{x+t} \\
    [\ln S_0(x+t)]^{n}_{0} &= - \int^{n}_{0} \mu_{x+t} \\
    \ln S_0(x+n) - \ln S_0(x) &= - \int^{n}_{0} \mu_{x+t} \\
    \ln \frac{S_0(x+n)}{\ln S_0(x)} &= - \int^{n}_{0} \mu_{x+t} \\
    \ln S_{x}(n) &= - \int^{n}_{0} \mu_{x+t} \\
    S_{x}(n) &= e^{- \int^{n}_{0} \mu_{x+t}} \\
    {}_{n}p_{x} &= e^{- \int^{n}_{0} \mu_{x+t}}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Note

    The exponent is also known as the **Cumulative Force of Mortality**.

    Outside of human survival, the force of mortality is more generally known as the **Hazard Function**, denoted by $h(x)$. Its integral is known as the **Cumulative Hazard Function**, denoted by $H(x)$.

    $$
        H(x) = \int^{n}_{0} h(x)
    $$

    Although rare, a question could *directly* provide the cumulative hazard function and ask to compute the survival probability. In such cases, DO NOT integrate it once more!

Following a similar generalization (proof not shown), the PDF can also be expressed using the force of mortality:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \mu_{x} &= \frac{f_0(x)}{S_0(x)} \\
    f_0(x) &= S_0(x) \cdot \mu_{x} \\
    f_x(t) &= S_x(t) \cdot \mu_{x+t} \\
    f_x(t) &= {}_{t}p_{x} \cdot \mu_{x+t}
\end{aligned}
$$

### **Risk Adjustments**

There are people who have a **higher risk of dying** than the average person - EG. Smokers.

The **first method** to account for their increased risk is to **treat them as an older person** (higher risk), known as an **Age Rating**.

An $n$ year age rating means that a person aged $x$ should be treated as if they had the mortality of a person aged $x+n$.

**Another method** would be to simply **scale the mortality rates** by a factor to increase it:

$$
    {}_{}q'_{x} = c \cdot {}_{}q'_{x}
$$

The **last method** would be to **adjust the force of mortality** instead, by either adding or multiplying a constant to it:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{}p'_{x}
    &= e^{- (\int^{n}_{0} \mu_{x+t} + k)} \\
    &= e^{- \int^{n}_{0} \mu_{x+t} - kn} \\
    &= e^{- \int^{n}_{0} \mu_{x+t}} \cdot e^{-kn} \\
    &= {}_{}p'_{x} \cdot e^{-kn} \\
    \\
    {}_{}p'_{x}
    &= e^{- k\int^{n}_{0} \mu_{x+t}} \\
    &= (e^{- \int^{n}_{0} \mu_{x+t}})^k \\
    &= ({}_{}p_{x})^k
\end{aligned}
$$

## **Moments**

### **Continuous Moments**

The first raw moment of the distribution is known as the **Complete Expectation of Life**, which can be calculated via first principles:

$$
    E(T_{x}) = \int_{0}^{\infty} t \cdot f_x(t) \\
$$

Note that integrating this expression directly requires **integration by parts**, which can be time consuming, this it can be simplified using the **Survival Function Method**.

Recall that in the previous section we found that the PDF and the survival function are related:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    f_{x}(t) &= - \frac{d}{dt} S_{x}(t) \\
    \therefore \int f_{x}(t) &= -S_{x}(t)
\end{aligned}
$$

This result can be used to simplify the integration by parts:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E(T_{x})
    &=  \Bigl[t \cdot \int f_x(t) \Bigr]_0^\infty - \int_{0}^{\infty} \int f_x(t) \cdot 1 \\
    &=  \Bigl[t \cdot (-S_X(t)) \Bigr]_0^\infty - \int_{0}^{\infty} (-S_X(x)) \\
    &= tS_X(\infty) - tS_X(0) + \int_{0}^{\infty} S_X(x) \\
    &= \infty \cdot (0) - 0 \cdot 1 + \int_{0}^{\infty} S_X(x) \\
    &= \int_{0}^{\infty} S_X(x) \\
    &= \int_0^\infty {}_{t}p_x
\end{aligned}
$$

The same logic can be applied to the second raw moment as well:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E(T^2_x)
    &= \int_{0}^{\infty} t^2 \cdot f_x(t) \\
    &= \Bigl[t^2 \cdot \int f_x(t) \Bigr]_0^\infty - \int_{0}^{\infty} \int f_x(t) \cdot 2t \\
    &= \Bigl[t^2 \cdot S_x(t)\Bigr]_0^\infty - \int_{0}^{\infty} 2t \cdot S_x(t) \\
    &= t^2 \cdot S_x(\infty) - t^2 \cdot S_x(0) - \int_{0}^{\infty} 2t \cdot S_x(t) \\
    &= (\infty)^2 \cdot 0 - 0^2 \cdot 1 - \int_{0}^{\infty} 2t \cdot S_x(t) \\
    &= \int_{0}^{\infty} 2t \cdot {}_{t}p_x
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Tip

    More generally, the survival function method can be expressed as the following:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        \int_{0}^{\infty} g(x) \cdot f_x(t)
        &= \int_{0}^{\infty} g'(x) \cdot S_x(t)
    \end{aligned}
    $$

The Variance is simply the difference of the first two raw moments with **no special simplification**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    Var(T_x)
    &= E(T^2_x) - [E(T_x)]^2 \\
    &= 2 \int_{0}^{\infty} t \cdot {}_{t}p_x - \left(\int_0^\infty {}_{t}p_x \right)^2
\end{aligned}
$$

### **Discrete Moments**

Similarly, the expectation of the discrete distribution is known as the **Expectation of Curtate Lifetime**.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E(K_x)
    &= \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} k \cdot {}_{k \mid 1}q_{x} \\
    &= \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} k ({}_{k}p_{x} - {}_{k+1}p_{x}) \\
    &= 1 ({}_{1}p_{x} - {}_{2}p_{x}) + 2 ({}_{2}p_{x} - {}_{3}p_{x}) + 3 ({}_{3}p_{x} - {}_{4}p_{x}) + ... \\
    &= {}_{1}p_{x} - {}_{2}p_{x} + 2 {}_{2}p_{x} - 2{}_{3}p_{x} + 3 {}_{3}p_{x} - 3 {}_{4}p_{x} \\
    &= {}_{1}p_{x} + {}_{2}p_{x} + {}_{3}p_{x} + ... \\
    &= \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} {}_{k}p_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Note

    Summation starts from 1 as the first term is cancelled
    Probability tree perspective

The second moment can be calculated in a similar fashion:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E(K^2_x)
    &= \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} k^2 ({}_{k}p_{x} - {}_{k+1}p_{x}) \\
    &= 1 ({}_{1}p_{x} - {}_{2}p_{x}) + 4 ({}_{2}p_{x} - {}_{3}p_{x}) + 9 ({}_{3}p_{x} - {}_{4}p_{x}) + ... \\
    &= {}_{1}p_{x} - {}_{2}p_{x} + 4{}_{2}p_{x} - 4{}_{3}p_{x} + 9 {}_{3}p_{x} - 9 {}_{4}p_{x} \\
    &= {}_{1}p_{x} + 3{}_{2}p_{x} + 5 {}_{3}p_{x} + ... \\
    &= \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} (2k-1) {}_{k}p_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

Similarly, the variance has **no special simplifications**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    Var(K_x)
    &= E(K_x^2) - [E(K_x)]^2 \\
    &= \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} (2k-1) {}_{k}p_{x} - \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} {}_{k}p_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

### **Temporary Expectation**

If the future lifetime variable is artifically limited to $n$ years, then the expectation is known as the **n-year temporary complete/curtate expectation of life**.

It is intepreted as the number of years that the person is expected to live **out of the next $n$ years** ONLY.

If the person lives past $n$ years, then only $n$ years are recorded. Thus, it can be represented using a **minimum function**:

$$
    \min (T_x, n)
    =
    \begin{cases}
        T_x,& T_x \lt n \\
        n,& T_x \gt n
    \end{cases}
$$

In order to easily represent and distinguish it from the full counterpart, the following **actuarial notation** is used:

\ltcenter\gt

|  | Complete | Curtate |

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \mathring{e}_{x} &= \int^{\infty}_0 {}_{t}p_x \\
    \mathring{e}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} &= \int^{n}_0 {}_{t}p_x \\
    \\
    e_{x} &= \sum^{\infty}_0 {}_{k}p_x \\
    e_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} &= \sum^{n}_0 {}_{k}p_x
\end{aligned}
$$

### **Decomposition**

The *complete* expectation can be **decomposed** into two components:

1. **Term Expectation** at the *current age* representing the "early" years
2. **Complete Expectation** at a *future age* represenging the "later" years

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \mathring{e}_x &\approx \mathring{e}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} + \mathring{e}_{x+n} \\
    e_x &\approx e_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} + e_{x+n}
\end{aligned}
$$

However, the above makes an implicit assumption that the person **will survive** the first n years. Thus, the second term needs to **account for the probability of surviving** those n years:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \mathring{e}_x &= \mathring{e}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} + {}_{n}p_{x} \cdot \mathring{e}_{x+n} \\
    e_x &= e_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} + {}_{n}p_{x} \cdot e_{x+n}
\end{aligned}
$$

Similarly, a temporary expectation can be further decomposed into more temporary expectations:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \mathring{e}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} &= \mathring{e}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{m}} + {}_{n}p_{x} \cdot \mathring{e}_{x+m+n} \\
    e_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} &= e_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{m}} + {}_{n}p_{x} \cdot e_{x+m+n}
\end{aligned}
$$

For the **curtate expectation only**, if $n=1$, it leads to a **recursion**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    e_x
    &= e_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{1}} + {}_{}p_{x} \cdot e_{x+1} \\
    &= {}_{}p_{x} + {}_{}p_x \cdot e_{x+1} \\
    &= {}_{}p_{x} (1 + e_{x+1})
\end{aligned}
$$

### **Discrete Continuous Link**

Note that the two expectations are similar to one another:

* **Continuous Expectation** - Area under survival function
* **Discrete Expectation** - Right **Riemann Sum** of the area under the survival function

<!-- Obtained from Story of Mathematics -->
![Riemann Sum](Assets/1.%20Survival%20Models.md/Right%20Riemann%20Sum.png){.center}

Recall from Calculus that the area under a curve can be estimated through the **Trapezium Rule**, which states that the area is *approximately equal* to the sum of the area of discrete trapeziums formed under the curve.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \int^b_a f(x)
    & \approx \sum \text{Area of Trapezium} \\
    & \approx \sum \frac{1}{2} h \left[f(a+kh) + f(a+(k+1)h) \right] \\
    & \approx \frac{h}{2}[f(a) + f(a+h)] + \frac{h}{2}[f(a+h) + f(a+2h)] + \dots + \frac{h}{2}[f(b-h) + f(b)] \\
    & \approx \frac{h}{2} f(a) + h[f(a+h) + f(a+2h) + \dots + f(b-h)] + \frac{h}{2} f(b) \\
    & \approx h[f(a+h) + f(a+2h) + \dots + f(b-h)] + \frac{h}{2} [f(a)+f(b)] \\
    & \approx h[f(a) + f(a+h) + \dots + f(b)] - \frac{h}{2} [f(a)+f(b)] \\
    & \approx h[f(a) + f(a+h) + \dots + f(b-h)] - \frac{h}{2} [f(a)-f(b)] \\
    & \approx h[f(a+h) + f(a+2h) + \dots + f(b)] + \frac{h}{2} [f(a)-f(b)]
\end{aligned}
$$

The proof relies on the fact that *other* than $f(a)$ and $f(b)$, **all other terms are repeated twice**. The last four lines are just different variations that showcase this property:

1. Both $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ excluded from main expression
2. Both $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ included in main expression but subtracted
3. Only $f(a)$ included in main expression; Main expression is a **Left Riemman Sum**
4. Only $f(b)$ included in main expression; Main expression is a **Right Riemman Sum**

<!-- Trapezium Rule -->
![Trapezium Rule](Assets/1.%20Survival%20Models.md/Trapezium%20Rule.png){.center}

Since the discrete expectation is a right riemann sum, the last expression of the trapezoidal rule should be used. This allows the continuous expectation to be expressed using the discrete expectation, assuming $h=1$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \mathring{e}_x
    &= \int^{\infty}_{0} S_x(t) \\
    & \approx h[f(a+h) + f(a+2h) + \dots + f(b)] + \frac{h}{2} [f(a)-f(b)] \\
    & \approx (1) [S_x(1) + S_x(2) + \dots + S_x(\infty)] + \frac{1}{2} [S_x(0)-S_x(\infty)] \\
    & \approx [S_x(1) + S_x(2) + \dots + S_x(\infty)] + \frac{1}{2} [1-0] \\
    & \approx e_x + \frac{1}{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

An alternative way to view the above is that the area of the trapezoid is the **sum of the riemann rectangles and a triangle**.

### **Euler Maclaurin Formula**

Note that the Trapezoidal Rule is *not perfect* - there is an **inherent error** in trying to approximate a curve using a line.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \int^b_a f(x) & \approx \sum (\text{Area of Trapezium} + \text{Error})\\
\end{aligned}
$$

The error can be positive or negative, depending on the shape of the curve in that interval:

<!-- Obtained from Wikipedia -->
![Trapezoidal Error](Assets/1.%20Survival%20Models.md/Trapezoidal%20Error.png){.center}

The error term is calculated by taking the difference between the integral and the trapezium, and is generalized using the taylor series. The final result is known as the **Euler Maclaurin Formula**:

$$
    \sum \text{Error} = \frac{h^2}{12} [f'(a)-f'(b)]
$$

\gt Given that a taylor series was used, the error can be expressed as the sum of many different terms, but **higher powers are ignored**.

Thus, the trapezoidal approximation for the expectation can be made more precise:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \mathring{e}_x
    & \approx e_x + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1^2}{12} [S'(0)-S'(\infty)] \\
    & \approx e_x + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{12} [S'(0)]
\end{aligned}
$$

The above will rarely be used in this manner - it is more than sufficient to know the relationship between the two expectations of life. However, it sets as a strong foundation to understand the **Woolhouse Approximation** in the life annuities section.

## **Parametric Survival Models**

Given the importance of $\mu_x$, several mathematical functions have been made to describe the force of mortality, known as a **Parametric Survival Model**.

### **Exponential Distribution**

When the **force of mortality is constant** $\mu_{x} = \mu$, the PDF can be shown to be exponential:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{}p_x
    &= e^{- \int^{t}_{0} \mu} \\
    &= e^{- \mu t}\\
    \\
    f(x)
    &= {}_{}p_x \cdot \mu \\
    &= \mu \cdot e^{- \mu t} \\
    \\
    \therefore T_{x} &\sim \text{Exponential}(\mu) \\
    E(T_x) &= \frac{1}{\mu} \\
    Var (T_x) &= \frac{1}{\mu^2}
\end{aligned}
$$

The key is to remember that distribution is **Memoryless**, which means that the **age of the person** does not matter:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{n}p_{x} &= {}_{n}p_{x+m} \\
    \\
    \therefore {}_{n}p_{x}
    &= {}_{}p_{x} \cdot {}_{}p_{x+1} \cdot {}_{}p_{x+2} \cdot \dots \\
    &= {}_{}p_{x} \cdot {}_{}p_{x} \cdot {}_{}p_{x} \cdot \dots \\
    &= ({}_{}p_{x})^n
\end{aligned}
$$

This leads to an interesting relationship between the full and temporary expectation:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \mathring{e}_{x} &= \mathring{e}_{x+m} \\
    \\
    \therefore \mathring{e}_x &= \mathring{e}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} + {}_{n}p_{x} \cdot \mathring{e}_{x+n} \\
    \mathring{e}_x &= \mathring{e}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} + {}_{n}p_{x} \cdot \mathring{e}_{x} \\
    \mathring{e}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} &= \mathring{e}_x - {}_{n}p_{x} \cdot \mathring{e}_{x} \\
    \mathring{e}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} &= \mathring{e}_x \cdot (1 - {}_{n}p_{x})
\end{aligned}
$$

### **De Moivre's Model**

**De Moivre's Law** assumes that the **distribution of a NEWBORN** is **uniformly distributed** between 0 and $\omega$.

!!! Note

    $\omega$ is known as the **Limiting Age**. It is the age that everyone is expected to die by.

$$
    T_{0} \sim \text{Uniform}(0, \omega)
$$

It can be adjusted to fit the distribution of a person aged $x$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    T_{x} &= T_{0} - x \mid T_{0} \gt x \\
    \therefore T_{x} &\sim \text{Uniform}(0, \omega-x) \\
    \\
    f(x) &= \frac{1}{\omega-x} \\
    E(T_{x}) &= \frac{\omega-x}{2} \\
    Var(T_{x}) &= \frac{(\omega-x)^2}{12}
\end{aligned}
$$

### **Gompertz Model**

Both the above distributions make unrealistic assumptions:

1. **Exponential Distribution**: Assume age does not matter
2. **Uniform Distribution**: Assume equal number of people die eacg tear

A more realistic model is the **Gompertz Model**, which suggests that **mortality increases with age**:

$$
    \mu_{x} = Bc^{x} \\
$$

Thus, the corresponding survival function can be calculated:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t}p_{x}
    &= e^{-\int^{n}_{0} Bc^{x+s}} \\
    &= e^{-Bc^{x} \int^{n}_{0} c^{s}} \\
    &= e^{-Bc^{x} [\frac{c^s}{\ln c}]^t_0} \\
    &= e^{-Bc^{x} [\frac{c^t}{\ln c} - \frac{c^0}{\ln c}]} \\
    &= e^{\frac{-Bc^{x}}{\ln c} (c^t - 1)}
\end{aligned}
$$

### **Makeham Gompertz Model**

Makeham added a **constant** $A$ into the Gompertz model, resulting in the **Makeham Gompertz Model**:

$$
    \mu_{x} = A + Bc^{x}
$$

$A$ represents the **age independent mortality** - dying from reasons unrelated to age, such as from accidents or natural catastrophes.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    S_x(t)
    &= e^{- \int^{t}_{0} A + Bc^{x+t}} \\
    &= e^{\int^{t}_{0} -A - Bc^{x+t}} \\
    &= e^{\left[-At - \frac{B}{\ln c} c^{x+t} \right]^{t}_{0}} \\
    &= e^{\left[-At - \frac{B}{\ln c} c^{x+t} \right] - \left[-\frac{B}{\ln c} c^{x} \right]} \\
    &= e^{-At - \frac{B}{\ln c} c^{x+t} + \frac{B}{\ln c} c^{x}} \\
    &= e^{-At - \frac{B}{\ln c} c^x [c^t - 1]} \\
    &= e^{-At} \cdot e^{- \frac{B}{\ln c} c^x [c^t - 1]}
\end{aligned}
$$
