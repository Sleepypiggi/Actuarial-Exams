# **Model Estimation**

This section assumes some basic knowledge on **Model Estimation**, which can be found under another set of notes covering [Model Estimation](../ASA-FAMS/8. Model Estimation.md).

## **Overview**

This chapter follows a similar motivation to the FAM-S one - rather than making an assumption about the survival distribution, it is better to directly study it instead.

All the same principles about data apply, but instead of studying loss amounts, we are now interested in studying the **times to death** of people.

## **Complete Data**

Given complete data, the probability of survival is simply the ratio of the number of survivors to the total number of people.

However, since the probability of survival can be calculated for different lengths of time $(k)$, the number of survivors is dependent on the length of time chosen.

$$
    \hat{S}_x(t) = \frac{\text{# of people who survive past t}}{n}
$$

## **Incomplete Data**

### **Grouped Data**

For grouped data, if the $k$ is at the boundary of the ranges provided, then the number of survivors can be easily determined and the survival probability is calculated the same way as before:

$$
    \hat{S}_x(t) = \frac{\text{# of observations larger than k}}{n}
$$

However, if $k$ is within the range, by assuming that values within the range are **uniformly distributed**, then the probability can be **linearly interpolated** from the probabilities at the boundary.

!!! Warning

    Similar to the fractional age interpolation, recall that the **larger weight should be applied to the boundary age** that the estimated age is nearest to.

The interpolation follows the same intuition as the fractional age assumption, where the uniform assumption results in a linear graph of probabilities:

Censored and Truncated data can only be worked with using dedicated methods discussed below.

### **Kaplan Meier Estimation**

Consider a study of 5 individuals:

* One individual dies at $t=0.8$ and $t=1.4$
* 5 more individuals join the study at $t=1$; **Left Truncated** at $t=1$
* 3 individual leave the study at $t=0.5$; **Right Censored** at $t=0.5$

Exam questions often present the information in a table format:

* $t$ represents the **time** of death
* $d$ represents the number of **deaths**
* $r$ represents the **risk set** RIGHT BEFORE death; simply known as the **sample size**

!!! Tip

    Although the table is what is provided, a more effective way to visualize the problem is via the timeline seen above.

This is problematic as the **sample size changes** throughout the study. However, the **Kaplan Meier** method accounts for this by calculating the survival probability as the **product** of the **survival probabilities** for **all previous intervals between deaths**:

$$
    \hat{S}_x(t) = \prod \left(1-\frac{d_j}{r_j} \right)
$$

!!! Note

    This means that the **ratio** between the estimator at **two consecutive times** of death is the the survival probability at the later time.

    However, remember that the first estimate provided is the combination of all survival probabilities before it, just that they were **not provided**. It should NOT be used to directly reverse engineer the sample size etc.

Given the above example, the resulting Kaplan Meier estimation would be:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \hat{S}_0(1.4)
    &= P(t > 0.8) * P(t > 1.4 | x > 0.8) \\
    &= \left (1 - \frac{1}{2} \right) * \left (1 - \frac{1}{6} \right) \\
    &= \left (\frac{1}{2} \right) * \left (\frac{5}{6} \right) \\
    &= \frac{5}{12}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Warning

    Although this example (and many other questions) assume that there is only one death at a time, it is completely possible to have a **different number of deaths**.

    This is especially so when the probabilities are already provided by the question - **always solve for the precise number of deaths** to be sure.

    Although counter-intuitive, the number of deaths calculated this way do NOT need to be discrete!

This results in a **constant probability between deaths**. Thus, the focus is on the **times of death**; the entries and exits from the study are only used to change the sample size.

### **Nelson Aelen Estimation**

Recall that the survival probability can be expressed as a function of the Force of Mortality:

$$
    \hat{S}_x(t) = e^{- \int^t_0 \mu_{x+t}}
$$

The **Nelson Aelen** method estimates the **Cumulative Force of Mortality** (the exponent of the expression), which can be then used to compute the survival probability.

!!! Warning

    It is an extremely common mistake to take the result of the Nelson Aelen estimation as the survival probability.

The nelson aelen estimator is computed as the **sum** of the **death probabilities** for **all previous intervals between deaths**:

$$
    \int^t_0 \mu_{x+t} = \sum \frac{d_j}{r_j}
$$

!!! Warning

    Similar to the Kaplan Estimator, the **difference** at two consecutive times is the death probability at the later time. The same warning applies.

Given the previous example, the resulting Nelson Aelen estimation would be:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \int^t_0 \mu_{x+1.4}
    &= P(t < 0.8) + P(t < 1.4 | x > 0.8) \\
    &= \left (\frac{1}{2} \right) + \left (\frac{1}{6} \right) \\
    &= \frac{2}{3} \\
    \\
    {}_{1.4}\hat{p}_x
    &= e^{-\frac{2}{3}} \\
    &= 0.51171
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Note

    The results for the two methods are not that far off from one another. They can be used as to sense check each other if asked to calculate both.

### **Dead Alive Model**

Unlike the Nelson Aelen method, the MLE **DIRECTLY estimates the force of mortality**, which can be then used to compute survival probabilities.

One key concept is the idea of **Central Exposed to Risk** ($E^c_x$), which is a measure of *how long* the individual has been **alive in the study** at the time.

Consider the following example to estimate the force of mortality at **age 51**:

<!-- Obtained from Coaching Actuaries -->
![CER Example A](Assets/8.%20Model%20Estimation.md/CER%20Example%20A.png){.center}

Firstly, we need to determine if and when the individuals turn 51:

<!-- Obtained from Coaching Actuaries -->
![CER Example B](Assets/8.%20Model%20Estimation.md/CER%20Example%20B.png){.center}

The **date they turn 51** is used as the **starting point** for the $E^c_x$. The ending point is based on the **year that they turn 51** and is one of the following:

* **Date of death** - Died during the year
* **Date of withdrawal** - Left during the year
* **Date they turn 52** - Survived the entire year

From this, $E^c_x$ is calculated **in years**:

<!-- Obtained from Coaching Actuaries -->
![CER Example C](Assets/8.%20Model%20Estimation.md/CER%20Example%20C.png){.center}

Using the CER, the force of mortality can be determined:

$$
    \hat{\mu}_x = \frac{d_x}{E^c_x}
$$

Assuming that this **force is constant**, the resulting survival probability is calculated as:

$$
    \hat{S}_x(t) = e^{-\hat{\mu}_x}
$$

### **Maximum Likelihood Estimation**

Given a distribution for future lifetime, MLE can also be used to estimate the parameters of that distribution via first principles.

Recall that for a continuous distribution, the PDF is used to form the likelihood function:

$$
    f(x) = {}_{t}p_{x} \cdot \mu_{x+t}
$$

All other key concepts from FAM-S apply:

* **Joining the study late**: Left Truncated; divide pdf by survival function
* **Leaving the study early**: Right Censored; replace PDF with survival function

!!! Tip

    Most likely, questions of this nature will use the **Gompertz Model**. Thus, $\mu$ and ${}_{t}p_{x}$ can be easily found from the formula sheet.

## **Statistical Inference**

Given that all the above methods are estimates of the survival probability, the estimated values will change depending on the underlying sample.

Thus, it is important to consider the variance of the estimators as well across various different samples.

### **Complete Variance**

Recall that the number of survivors follows a Binomial Distribution. Thus, its variance can be computed using the variance of the binomial distribution:

$$
    Var(\text{Number of Survivors}) = n \cdot {}_{t}p_x \cdot (1-{}_{t}p_x)
$$

Thus, the variance of the complete estimator can be easily computed as the following:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    Var(\hat{S}_x(t))
    &= Var \left(\frac{\text{Number of Survivors}}{n} \right) \\
    &= \frac{1}{n^2} Var(\text{Number of Survivors}) \\
    &= \frac{1}{n^2} n \cdot {}_{t}p_x \cdot (1-{}_{t}p_x) \\
    &= \frac{{}_{t}p_x \cdot (1-{}_{t}p_x)}{n} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

Since the actual survival probability is not known, it is often substituted with the estimate:

$$
    Var(\hat{S}_x(t)) = \frac{\hat{S}_x(t) \cdot (1-\hat{S}_x(t))}{n}
$$

Note that the variance of the estimated death probability is **identical** to that of the survival probability:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    Var({}_{t}\hat{q}_x)
    &= Var(1 - \hat{S}_x(t)) \\
    &= Var(\hat{S}_x(t)) \\
\end{aligned}
$$

### **Incomplete Variance**

Due to the complexity of calculating the variance under these methods, the formula for variances are provided in the formula sheets; no further explanations will be provided.

**Kaplan Meier Variance**:

$$
    Var(\hat{S}_x(t)) = (\hat{S}_x(t))^2 \sum \frac{d_j}{r_j (r_j - d_j)}
$$

**Nelson Aelen Variance**:

$$
    Var(\hat{S}_x(t)) = (\hat{S}_x(t))^2 \sum \frac{d_j (r_j - d_j)}{r^3_j}
$$

**Maximum Likelihood Variance**:

$$
    Var(\hat{S}_x(t)) = (\hat{S}_x(t))^2 \cdot \frac{d_x}{\left(E^c_x \right)^2}
$$

### **Confidence Intervals**

Assuming that the estimators follow a normal distribution, a standard **linear confidence interval** can be calculated as the following:

$$
    \hat{S}_x(t) \pm Z_{\frac{1+p}{2}} \sqrt{Var(\hat{S}_x(t))}
$$

However, one problem with a linear confidence interval for probabilities is that **upper and lower bound can exceed 0 and 1 respectively**, which is unintuitive.

Thus, the **log-transformed** confidence interval can be used instead:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{Confidence Interval}
    &= \left((\hat{S}_x(t))^{\frac{1}{U}}, (\hat{S}_x(t))^{U} \right) \\
    \\
    U &= \exp \left(\frac{Z_{\frac{1+p}{2}} \cdot \sqrt{Var(\hat{S}_x(t))}}{\hat{S}_x(t) \cdot \ln \hat{S}_x(t)} \right)
\end{aligned}
$$

Unfortunately, this formula is not provided on the formula sheet and thus must be memorized.
