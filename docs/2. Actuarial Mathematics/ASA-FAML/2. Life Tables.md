# **Life Tables**

The Discrete Survival Model above can be expressed in tabular form as well, known as a **Life Table**. Instead of providing the probabilities directly, it provides the **expected number of people alive at a given age** $l_x$. From these values, the probability rates can be calculated.

The lowest age of the life table is known as the **Starting Age**, denoted by $\alpha$. Conversely, the highest age is known as the **Terminal Age**, denoted by $\omega$.

The number of people alive at the starting age is known as the **Radix** of the life table, which is usually a large round number; $l_{\alpha} = 100,000$. All members of the poulation are expected to gradually die by the terminal age; $l_{\omega} = 0$.

$$
l_x > l_{x+t}

An additional column for $d_x$ can also be calculated, which represents the **expected number of people who die within a year**; from age $x$ to age $x+1$. Note that because the life table is decreasing, it is written from the perspective of $x$, not $x+1$.

$$
d_x = l_x - l_{x+1}
$$

If the life table is incomplete, $d_x$ can be used to fill up the remaining information:

$$
l_x - l_{x+n} = d_x + d_{x+1} + ... d_{x+n-1}
$$

The probability of death/survival **over a period** can be calculated as the **proportion of people who died/survived** in that period:

$$
\begin{aligned}
{}_{t}p_{x} &= \frac{l_{x+t}}{l_x} \\
{}_{t}q_{x} &= \frac{l_x - l_{x+t}}{l_x} \\
{}_{s|t}q_{x} &= \frac{l_{x+s} - l_{x+s+t}}{l_{x}} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

If considering only the probabilities for a **single period**, then $d_x$ can be used as well:

$$
\begin{aligned}
p_{x} &= \frac{l_x - d_x}{l_x} \\
q_{x} &= \frac{d_x}{l_x} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

If the life table only includes the yearly probabilities, then the probability over a specific period can be calculated via first principles using a probability tree:

$$
{}_{t}q_{x} = q_x + p_x * q_{x+1} + p_x * p_{x+1} * q_{x+2} + ... p_{x} * p _{x+1} * ... p_{x+n-2} * q_{x+n-1}
