# **Life Tables**

Life Tables existed long before the survival models in the previous section. The mortality functions were presented in tabular form, where the probabilities and expectations were then calculated from.

Both the survival model and life table are equivalent ways of obtaining the same results.

## **Basic Life Table**

The life table is constructed based on the mortality of a **group of people** known as the **Cohort**.

The initial age of the group people is known as the **Starting Age**, denoted by $\alpha$. The initial number of people in the cohort is known as the **Radix**, which is usually a large round number (EG. 1000)

Conversely, the maximum age is known as the **Terminal Age**, denoted by $\omega$. Everybody in the cohort is expected to gradually **die by the terminal age**.

The number of people alive from the cohort at age $x$ is denoted as $\ell_x$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \ell_0 &= 1000 \\
    \ell_{\omega} &= 0 \\
    \\
    \therefore \ell_{x+t} &< \ell_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

From this basic life table, several important values can be calculated:

1. The **expected number of deaths** over a period, ${}_{n}d_{x}$
2. The probability of **survival** past a period, ${}_{n}p_{x}$
3. The probability of **death** within a period, ${}_{n}q_{x}$
4. The **deferred** probability of death within a period, ${}_{s|t}q_{x}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{n}d_{x} &= \ell_{x} - \ell_{x+n} \\
    {}_{n}p_{x} &= \frac{\ell_{x+t}}{\ell_{x}} \\
    {}_{n}q_{x} &= \frac{{}_{n}d_{x}}{\ell_{x}} \\
    {}_{s|t}q_{x} &= \frac{{}_{t}d_{x+s}}{l_{x}} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, it can be seen that the probabilities are simply the proportion of people who died/survived over the a given period.

## **Fractional Age Assumptions**

One limitation of the life table is that it is computed at discrete ages while many problems require computations for non-discrete ages.

Thus, several **assumptions** about the life table that allows non-discrete values to be **interpolated** from the discrete ones, known as **Fractional Age Assumptions**.

### **Uniform Distribution of Deaths**

The **Uniform Distribution of Deaths** (UDD) is an assumption that allows for **Linear Interpolation** between discrete ages.

As its name suggests, it assumes that there is a uniform distribution of deaths within each year of age, such that the survival function decreases uniformly, resulting in a **linear survival function** between ages.

Let the fractional age be $s$. Thus, the probability using fractional ages is simply the **weighted average** of the discrete points:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{s}p_{x}
    &= (1-s) {}_{0}p_{x} + s {}_{1}p_{x} \\
    &= (1-s)\frac{\ell_{x}}{\ell_{x}} + s \frac{\ell_{x+1}}{\ell_{x}} \\
    &= \frac{\ell_{x}-s\ell_{x} + s\ell_{x+1}}{\ell_{x}} \\
    &= \frac{\ell_{x} - s(\ell_{x}-\ell_{x+1})}{\ell_{x}} \\
    &= \frac{\ell_{x} - s d_{x}}{\ell_{x}} \\
    &= \frac{\ell_{x}}{\ell_{x}} - s\frac{d_{x}}{\ell_{x}} \\
    &= 1 - s q_{x} \\
    \\
    \therefore {}_{s}q_{x} &= s \cdot q_x
\end{aligned}
$$

### **Constant Force of Mortality**

The **Constant Force of Mortality** is an assumption that allows for Exponential Interpolation between discrete ages.
 
## **Select & Ultimate Mortality**

Mortality rates for the general population versus individuals who buy life insurance tend to be different. Generally speaking, people who purchase insurance tend to be richer and thus have **better mortality rates than the general population**.

Within the individuals who purchase life insurance, those who have **recently purchased a policy tend to have better mortality**. This is because these individuals would have gone through **Medical Underwriting** and thus is expected to be in better health.

The extent of the better mortality **decreases over time** and after a few years, they should experience the **same mortality** as the rest of the individuals who purchased life insurance. The duration of time is dependent on the *rigorousness of the underwriting process*.

Formally speaking, the individuals who purchased life insurance were *selected* by the underwriting process and thus the better mortality experienced is known as **Select Mortality**. Similarly, the time whereby the select mortality is better is known as the **Select Period**. The select mortality *ultimately* converges with the non-select group, known as the **Ultimate Mortality**.

In actuarial notation, subscript $[x]$ is used to distinguish select mortality from ultimate mortality, where the select period is denoted as $d$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \begin{cases}
        q_{[x]+t} < q_{x+t},& t < d \\
        q_{[x]+t} = q_{x+t},& t \ge d
    \end{cases}
\end{aligned}
$$
