# **Multi State Models**

## **Overview**

The survival model in FAM-L was sufficient to analyze the simplest form of life insurance and annuities which paid a benefit upon death or for as long as the policyholder is alive.

In practice, the benefit structure is a lot more complicated, depending on not only the survival of the policyholder but their health or the manner in which they die.

To effectively analyze these products, the survival model must be reformulated into a **Multi-State Model** which can account for these additional complexities.


## **Key Concepts**

A **State** is a set of **discrete statuses** that the policyholder can be in. For instance, a policyholder could be Healthy, Sick or Dead:

In its simplest form, the policyholder can be either **alive or dead**, resulting in a simple two state model:

!!! Note

    For instance, the following multi-state model is used analyze **Disability Income Insurance**, which pays out benefits for as long as they are **Sick** (Disabled):



The state in which the policyholder **starts** with is known as the **Natural State**, commonly denoted as **State 0**.

They can then **transition** into another state (1,2, ...) or **stay** in the same state. Depending on the model, it may also be possible to transition back into the previous state.

If it possible to transition out of a particular state, it is known as a **Transient State**. Otherwise, it is known as a **Reccurrent State**.

Mathematically, they are represented through the **random variable** $Y_{t}$, where $Y_{t} = i$ denotes that the policyholder is in state $i$ at time $t$:

<center>

| Transition | No Transition |
| :-: | :-: |
| Probability of transition from $i$ to $j$ | Probability of **NO transition** from state $i$ |
| $P \left(Y_{x+t} = j \mid Y_{x} = i \right)$ | $P \left(Y_{x+t} = i, \text{for all t} \mid Y_{x} = i \right)$ |
| ${}_{t}p^{ij}_{x}$ | ${}_{t}p^{\bar{ii}}_{x}$ |

</center>

!!! Tip

    The two have the following relationship:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        {}_{t}p^{\bar{ii}}_{x} \le {}_{t}p^{ii}_{x}       
    \end{aligned}
    $$

    This is due to the **definition** of the two probabilities, making the LHS a subset of the RHS:

    * **LHS**: Must **stay** in state $i$
    * **RHS**: Stay in state $i$ OR **transition out and back** to state $i$ by time t

The key assumption made is that the probability of transition is only dependent on the **current state** of the policyholder; it is independent of all previously attained states:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    P(Y_{t+1} = i \mid Y_{t} = j, Y_{t-1} = k, \dots)
    &= P(Y_{t+1} = i \mid Y_{t} = j)
\end{aligned}
$$

This is known as the **Markov Property**, which is why this system is generally known as a **Markov Process**. 

Since they are independent, the probabilities of making multiple transitions

## **Discrete Model**

A **Discrete Multi State Model** is one that only allows for transitions at **discrete times**. They are more generally known as **Markov Chains**.

Limited number, feasible?

Given $n$ possible states in the system, the **probabilities of transitioning** at every state can be summarized into an $n * n$ **transition matrix**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \begin{pmatrix}
        p_{x}^{00} & p_{x}^{01} & \dots & p_{x}^{0n} \\
        p_{x}^{10} & p_{x}^{11} & \dots & p_{x}^{1n} \\
        \vdots & & \ddots \\
        p_{x}^{n0} & p_{x}^{n1} & \dots & p_{x}^{nn}
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{aligned}
$$

There are a few key properties about the matrix:

* Each **row** represents the state that the policyholder is **transitioning from**
* Each **column** represents the state that the policyholder is **transitioning into**
* The probabilities in **each row must sum to 1** as they represent all possible transitions from the current state:

$$
    p_{x}^{00} + p_{x}^{01} + \dots + p_{x}^{0n} = 1
$$

!!! Warning

    The transition matrix captures **ALL combinations** of state transitions, not just what is possible. Thus, a large chunk of these probabilities will be 0.

## **Continuous Model**

Conversely, a **Continuous Multi State Model** allows for transitions at any time, more generally known as a **Continuous Markov Chain**.

Since transitions can occur at any time, it is impossible to compute the transition probabilities at every possible time point.
