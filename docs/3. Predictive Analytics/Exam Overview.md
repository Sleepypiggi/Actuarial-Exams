# **Overview of Predictive Analytics**

Predictive Analytics is the usage of **statistical models** to analyze historical or current data to make **predictions** about the future or unknown events.

Due to the growing relevance of **Predictive Analytics**, the SOA has added a significant amount of material on the topic into the credentialling process:

1. Exam Statistics for Risk Modelling (SRM)
2. Exam Predictive Analytics (PA)
3. Exam Advanced Topics for Predictive Analytics (ATPA)

> Exam ATPA was added midway through 2022 to replace Exam IFM. Credit for IFM also counts towards credit for ATPA, thus this set of notes will NOT be covering ATPA.

All of them share the same theme of working with statistical models:

1. Constructing statistical models
2. Intepreting their outputs
3. Evaluating their performance

Exam SRM covers the **theory** about the various types of models, tested in the typical **MCQ format**. Unlike the other exams where most of the questions are quantitative, most of SRM's questions are *qualitative*.

Exam PA tests the same concepts in an **applied manner**, providing real data and a business problem to navigate through in a **written format**. Exam ATPA builds on both of these exams, covering more advanced concepts in a business context.
