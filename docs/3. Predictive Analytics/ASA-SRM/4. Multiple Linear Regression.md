# **Multiple Linear Regression**

The natural extension of the SLR model is to include **more than one independent variable**, which thus results in the **Multiple Linear Regression** (MLR) model.

$$
E(Y|X_1, ... X_p) = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + \beta_2X_2 + ... + \beta_{p}X_{p}
$$

The goal of the MLR model is to study how all the $X$'s operate **together** to influence $Y$, not about how each individual $X$ is related to $Y$, which was the goal of the SLR model.

Unlike in SLR where the model could be expressed as a Line, the MLR model is expressed as a **Plane**. As such, $\beta_k$ represents the gradient of the plane in that particular dimension only?

> For avoidance of doubt, the subscript $i$ will be used to denote observations while $j$ will be used to denote independent variables.

## **Ordinary Least Squares**

For convenience, the MLR is often expressed in **Matrix notation**:

<!-- Express in matrix form -->

<!-- Express Beta1 in matrix form, no closed form -->

## **Goodness of Fit**

<!-- Include generalized F test -->

## **Statistical Inference**

<!-- Include Partial Correlation -->

## **Model Variations**

### **Interaction Model**
