# **Simple Linear Regression**

Simple Linear Regression (SLR) assumes a **Linear Relationship** between a **Numeric** independent and dependent *variable*. It is the *simplest* of all forms of statistical models (hence the name), but it is well suited to demonstrate the fundamental concepts of statistical modelling.

$$
y = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 x
$$



Note that Y and X are **vectors** which represent the collection of **all values of the independent variable** and their corresponding dependent variable.

$\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ are known as the **Parameters** of the model as they **define the relationship** between the variables. 

$\varepsilon$ is the **Error term** which is a **catch-all for all other factors** that the model does not capture.
