Ideally, the model should have low variance such that it would be relatively stable across different training data.</p> <p>While more complex models are better able to capture signals, this makes them prone to overfitting and hence more sensitive to differences in the training data, leading to higher variance.</p> <p>Note that although Precision &amp; Accuracy are both synonyms in English, they have distinct meanings in statistics.</p> <p></p> <p>Ideally, a model should have both low bias and low variance. However, as explained above, there is an inherent tension between Bias and Variance due to the complexity of the model, known as the Bias-Variance Tradeoff.</p> <p>A relatively simple model (underfitted) tends to have a high bias but low variance. As the complexity increases, the bias initially decreases more than the variance increases, causing the test MSE to fall.</p> <p>At some point, the model becomes too complex (overfitted), where the increase in variance outweighs the fall in bias, resulting in the U-shaped curve as seen previously.</p> <p>Thus, the goal is to find an optimal balance in between Bias and Variance where the test MSE is minimized.</p>"},{"location":"3.%20Predictive%20Analytics/ASA-SRM/5.%20Statistical%20Learning/#resampling-methods","title":"Resampling Methods","text":""},{"location":"3.%20Predictive%20Analytics/ASA-SRM/5.%20Statistical%20Learning/#validation-set","title":"Validation Set","text":""},{"location":"3.%20Predictive%20Analytics/ASA-SRM/5.%20Statistical%20Learning/#loo-cross-validation","title":"LOO Cross Validation","text":""},{"location":"3.%20Predictive%20Analytics/ASA-SRM/5.%20Statistical%20Learning/#k-fold-cross-validation","title":"K fold Cross Validation","text":""},{"location":"3.%20Predictive%20Analytics/ASA-SRM/5.%20Statistical%20Learning/#model-selection","title":"Model Selection","text":""},{"location":"3.%20Predictive%20Analytics/ASA-SRM/5.%20Statistical%20Learning/#feature-selection","title":"Feature Selection","text":""},{"location":"3.%20Predictive%20Analytics/ASA-SRM/5.%20Statistical%20Learning/#forward-stepwise-selection","title":"Forward Stepwise Selection","text":""},{"location":"3.%20Predictive%20Analytics/ASA-SRM/5.%20Statistical%20Learning/#backward-stepwise-selection","title":"Backward Stepwise Selection","text":""},{"location":"3.%20Predictive%20Analytics/ASA-SRM/5.%20Statistical%20Learning/#stepwise-selection","title":"Stepwise Selection","text":""},{"location":"3.%20Predictive%20Analytics/ASA-SRM/5.%20Statistical%20Learning/#shrinkage-methods","title":"Shrinkage Methods","text":""}]}
